 rrh portreath  is a remote radar head  operated by the royal air force it is situated at nancekuke common on the clifftops to the north of portreath beach and southwest of porthtowan in cornwall its radar housed in a fibre glass or golf ball protective dome provides longrange coverage of the south western approaches to the uk called raf portreath the base was built during 1940 opened in march 1941 and had a varied career during the second world war initially as a raf fighter command station from october 1941 as a ferry stopover for aircraft bound tofrom north africa and the middle east as a temporary stopover for usaaf and rcaf units and then as a coastal command station by the end of the war it had run down and in may 1950 was handed back to the government by the raf the base reverted to its local name nancekuke and became an outstation of chemical defence establishment cde porton down manufacture of the nerve agent sarin commenced there in the early 1950s and nancekuke became an important factory for stockpiling the uks chemical defences during the cold war periodically small amounts of vx were also produced at nancekuke production of vx agent was intended mainly for laboratory test purposes but also to validate plant designs and optimise chemical processes for potential massproduction however fullscale massproduction of vx agent never took place in the late 1950s the chemical weapons production plant at nancekuke was mothballed but was maintained through the 1960s and 1970s in a state whereby production of chemical weapons could easily recommence if required the cde buildings were demolished in 19791980 and the raf reopened the site as a manned radar station in october 1980 a control and reporting post crp for uk air surveillance in 1986 an underground crp was built as part of the new ukadge united kingdom air defence and ground environment project new mobile marconi electronic systems manufactured radar systems including an s723 martello raf type 91 and telecommunication installations were added during the mid1980s in the late nineties the installation became remote operation and the primary radar was replaced with the british aerospace bae type 101 the surrounding area is occasionally used for rallying portreaths parent station was raf st mawgan for administration but data was routed to raf neatishead in 2000 it was reported that former workers at the nancekuke base had died as a result of exposure to nerve gas and the matter was raised in the houses of parliament   it was alleged by the independent that toxic materials had been dumped in nearby mineshafts   works to cleanse the site began in 2003 
differential extraction also known as differential lysis refers to the process by which the dna from two different types of cells can be extracted without mixing their contents  the most common application of this method is the extraction of dna from vaginal epithelial cells and sperm cells from sexual assault cases in order to determine the dna profiles of the victim and the perpetrator  its success is based on the fact that sperm cells have protein disulfide bonds in their outer membrane which makes them more resilient to extraction than epithelial cells after determining that sperm cells are present typically through staining and light microscopy in a vaginalrectal sample the subjects epithelial cells are lysed by a standard dna extraction method like a phenolchloroform extraction and their dna extracted through normal means  the epithelial dna in solution is removed and saved while the sperm cells are still intact  differential extraction uses a chemical called dithiothreitol dtt to disrupt the sulfur bonds in the coating of the sperm cell in order to extract its dna  once the sperms outer membrane has been breached it is prone to standard dna extraction methods  this creates two different dna fractions from one sample hopefully that of the victim and that of the perpetrator however the described method is difficult to carry out very labor intensive and time consuming that backlogs of rape kits have built up an estimated 500000 rape kits alone in the us greenspoon et al reported improvements in sample processing efficiency and throughput using robotic automation however associated costs for implementation in conjunction with lowthroughput quantities of samples may be impractical for forensic laboratories and cannot be justified recently a multistep nucleic acid extraction procedure was introduced to provide dna lysates of highest quality a selfsealing membrane allows a stepwise release and separation of dna from mixed specimens implemented in a spincolumn system it is ideally suitable for dna extraction procedures involving differential extraction of forensic samples such as epithelium saliva or blood vs sperms simple and reliable extraction protocols for both stained samples as well as gynecological swabs respectively overcome the often claimed difficulties in differential extraction eg losing a sperm pellet through several washing steps furthermore an early qualified decision whether the process of a differential extraction is worth the time and efforts is possible due to gradual buffer separation as an immunological pretest for semen in a sample of sexual assault can be carried out using the identical sample first of all human proteins eg human semenogelin antigen can be optional isolated and immunologically analyzed to quickcheck for the presence of human seminal fluid if this test shows a positive result the same casework sample will be processed further the first part of the differential lysis is carried out under mild conditions to gain the female dna lysate of the epithelia cells is retained within the column even during heat incubation and moderate shaking upon centrifugation the solution passes the column into the collection tube the dna lysate is further purified and used to generate an autosomal str profile of the victim to further obtain the male dna which will identify the perpetrator harsher lysis conditions will be applied afterwards to the very same filter column without the necessity of sample carriage in order to break open the retained spermatozoa due to the high yield of dna the chance of a successful dnaprofile by downstream analysis is significantly increased this simple handling allows time savings and higher throughput in this manual process to improve crime solution rates and to speed up analysis of backlogged crime samples

the nisibis region was a metropolitan province of the church of the east between the fifth and seventeenth centuries  the province of nisibis syriac nisibin ܢܨܝܒܝܢ often abbreviated to soba ܨܘܒܐ had a number of suffragan dioceses at different periods in its history including arzun beth rahimaï beth qardu later renamed tamanon beth zabdaï qube d’arzun balad shigar sinjar armenia beth tabyathe and the kartawaye harran and callinicus raqqa maiperqat with amid and mardin reshʿaïna qarta and adarma qaimar and hesna dkifa  aoustan darzun and beth moksaye were also suffragan dioceses in the fifth century in 363 the roman emperor jovian was obliged to cede nisibis and five neighbouring districts to persia to extricate the defeated army of his predecessor julian from persian territory   the nisibis region after nearly fifty years of rule by constantine and his christian successors may well have contained more christians than the entire sassanian empire and this christian population was absorbed into the church of the east in a single generation  the impact of the cession of nisibis on the demography of the church of the east was so marked that the province of nisibis was ranked second among the five metropolitan provinces established at the synod of isaac in 410 a precedence apparently conceded without dispute by the bishops of the three older persian provinces relegated to a lower rank  the metropolitan of nisibis ranked below the metropolitan of ʿilam but above the metropolitans of maishan adiabene and beth garmaï the bishop of nisibis was recognised in canon xxi of the synod of isaac as metropolitan of arzun of qardu of beth zabdaï of beth rahimaï of beth moksaye and of the bishops to be found there and the bishops daniel of arzun samuel of arzun for baita daoustan daniel of beth moksaye and abraham of beth rahimaï were confirmed as his suffragans the bishop of nisibis was recognised in 410 as the metropolitan of arzun ܐܪܙܘܢ qardu ܩܪܕܘ beth zabdaï ܒܝܬ ܙܒܕܝ beth rahimaï ܒܝܬ ܪܚܡܝ and beth moksaye ܒܝܬ ܡܘܟܣܝܐ  these were the syriac names for arzanene corduene zabdicene rehimene and moxoene the five districts ceded by rome to persia in 363  the metropolitan diocese of nisibis ܢܨܝܒܝܢ and the suffragan dioceses of arzun qardu and beth zabdaï were to enjoy a long history but beth rahimaï is not mentioned again while beth moksaye is not mentioned after 424 when its bishop atticus probably from his name a roman subscribed to the acts of the synod of dadishoʿ  besides the bishop of arzun a bishop of aoustan d’arzun plausibly identified with the district of ingilene also attended these two synods and his diocese was also assigned to the province of nisibis  the diocese of aoustan darzun survived into the sixth century but is not mentioned after 554 during the fifth and sixth centuries three new dioceses in the province of nisibis were founded in persian territory in beth ʿarabaye the hinterland of nisibis between mosul and the tigris and khabur rivers and in the hill country to the northeast of arzun  by 497 a diocese had been established at balad the modern eski mosul on the tigris which persisted into the fourteenth century  by 563 there was also a diocese for shigar sinjar deep inside beth ʿarabaye and by 585 a diocese for beth tabyathe and the kartawaye the country to the west of lake van inhabited by the kartaw kurds the famous school of nisibis was an important seminary and theological academy of the church of the east during the late sassanian period and in the last two centuries of sassanian rule generated a remarkable outpouring of east syrian theological scholarship probably during the umayyad period the east syrian diocese of armenia was attached to the province of nisibis  the bishop artashahr of armenia was present at the synod of dadishoʿ in 424 but the diocese was not assigned to a metropolitan province  in the late thirteenth century armenia was certainly a suffragan diocese of the province of nisibis and its dependency probably went back to the seventh or eighth century  the bishops of armenia appear to have sat at the town of halat ahlat on the northern shore of lake van the arab conquest allowed the east syrians to move into western mesopotamia and establish communities in damascus and other towns that had formerly been in roman territory where they lived alongside much larger syrian orthodox armenian and melkite communities  some of these western communities were placed under the jurisdiction of the east syrian metropolitans of damascus but others were attached to the province of nisibis   the latter included a diocese for harran and callinicus raqqa first attested in the eighth century and last mentioned towards the end of the eleventh century and a diocese at maiperqat first mentioned at the end of the eleventh century whose bishops were also responsible for the east syrian communities in amid and mardin  eleventh and thirteenthcentury lists of dioceses in the province of nisibis also mention a diocese for the syrian town of reshʿaïna raʿs alʿain  reshʿaïna is a plausible location for an east syrian diocese at this period but none of its bishops are known changes in the formal and informal titles borne by the metropolitans of nisibis reflect the shifts in the provinces centre of gravity over the centuries  in 497 the metropolitan hosea of nisibis was styled metropolitan of the country of beth ʿarabaye  in the eleventh century the metropolitan ʿabdishoʿ ibn ʿarid of nisibis who became patriarch in 1074 was styled metropolitan bishop of soba nisibis and beth nahrin mesopotamia  at the end of the thirteenth century the celebrated east syrian writer ʿabdishoʿ bar brikha himself metropolitan of nisibis referred loosely to his province as soba nisibis and mediterranean syria  few mesopotamian or syrian dioceses still existed at this period however and ʿabdishoʿ was normally styled metropolitan of nisibis and armenia  as far as is known the title metropolitan of nisibis and armenia was used by all of ʿabdishoʿs successors until 1610 when the east syrian metropolitan province of nisibis was abolished ʿabdishoʿ bar brikha listed thirteen suffragan dioceses in the province of nisibis at the end of the thirteenth century in the following order  arzun qube beth rahimaï balad shigar qardu tamanon beth zabdaï halat harran amid reshʿaïna and adormiah qarta and adarma  it has been convincingly argued that ʿabdishoʿ was giving a conspectus of dioceses in the province of nisibis at various periods in its history rather than an authentic list of latethirteenth century dioceses and it is unlikely that the dioceses of qube beth rahimaï harran and reshʿaïna still existed at this period a diocese was founded around the middle of the thirteenth century to the north of the tur ʿabdin for the town of hesna dkifa perhaps in response to east syrian immigration to the towns of the tigris plain during the mongol period  at the same time a number of older dioceses may have ceased to exist  the dioceses of qaimar and qarta and adarma are last mentioned towards the end of the twelfth century and the diocese of tamanon in 1265 and it is not clear whether they persisted into the fourteenth century  the only dioceses in the province of nisibis definitely in existence at the end of the thirteenth century were armenia whose bishops sat at halat on the northern shore of lake van shigar balad arzun and maiperqat the bishop hosea of nisibis was confirmed as metropolitan of nisibis at the synod of

the diocese of shigar came to an end  the shigar region seems to have had a small nestorian community up to the seventeenth century and may even have had a bishop from time to time  a metropolitan glanan imech possibly maranʿemmeh of sciugar is mentioned in the report of 1607 and may have been a bishop of shigar  according to a yazidi tradition the last nestorian metropolitan of sinjar died around 1660 and the regions few remaining nestorian christians become yazidis   it is difficult to say whether there is any truth in this tradition the bishop klilishoʿ of beth tabyathe and the kartawaye was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of ishoʿyahb i in 585 the diocese of qarta and adarma was listed as a suffragan diocese in the province of nisibis in the mukhtasar of 10078 and a bishop mushe of qarta and adarma is attested during the reign of the catholicus eliya ii 1111–32  a ritual for the consecration of the bishop of qarta and adarma has survived in the works of the patriarch eliya iii 1176–90  finally a manuscript was copied in 1186 in the monastery of mar awgin near nisibis for the village of tel mahmad in the diocese of qarta  its colophon mentions that the manuscript was copied in the time of the patriarch eliya iii and the metropolitan yahballaha of nisibis providing further confirmation that qarta was a diocese in the province of nisibis qarta has been identified by fiey with the monastery of mar gabrona and mar shmona arabic dayr alqara near the lailah dagh twenty kilometres to the southeast of gazarta and adarma with the small town of adarma seventy kilometres east of nisibis near the modern tel rumaylan alkabir  the seat of the bishops of qarta and adarma may have been the monastery of gabrona and shmona mentioned in the colophons of manuscripts of 12134 and 12178 the east syrian diocese of armenia whose bishops sat in the town of halat on the northern shore of lake van is attested between the fifth and fourteenth centuries  in the fifth century the diocese of halat was not assigned to a metropolitan province but was later included in the province of nisibis probably shortly after the arab conquest  the patriarch timothy i created a metropolitan province for armenia presumably by raising the status of the diocese of halat  by the second half of the eleventh century halat was once again a suffragan diocese of the province of nisibis  by the thirteenth century the jurisdiction of the bishops of halat included the towns of van and wastan an unnamed bishop of qaimar was present at the consecration of the patriarch bar sawma in 1134 the bishop sabrishoʿ of qaimar was transferred to the diocese of kashkar by the patriarch eliya iii 1176–90 a diocese was founded around the middle of the thirteenth century to the north of the tur ʿabdin for the town of hesna dkifa the bishop eliya of hesna dkifa was present at the enthronement of makkikha ii in 1257 the bishop emmanuel of hesna d’kifa was present at the consecration of the patriarch yahballaha iii in 1281 the unperfected bishop ibn fadala guardian of the throne of nisibis and bishop of an unnamed diocese in the province of nisibis was present together with the metropolitan yohannan of nisibis at the consecration of the patriarch ʿabdishoʿ iii in 1139  he was required to proclaim the patriarchs name in the traditional ceremony in the church of mar pethion because all the bishops of the great eparchy beth aramaye had died and their thrones were vacant something which had never happened before

mintabie is an opal mining community in the  anangu pitjantjatjara yankunytjatjara or apy lands in south australia  it is unique in comparison to other communities situated in the apy lands in that its residents are largely not of indigenous australian origin and significant mining activity of opal gemstones is occurring mintabie is situated west of the stuart highway and approximately 35 kilometres northwest of marla  and 980 kilometres northwest of the capital of south australia adelaide  mintabie is approximately 200 kilometres south of the northern territory border mintabie sits in a geographical basin it is therefore not surprising that there is a lake basin near mintabie  the mintabie miners progress association describes the lake as follows the parcel of land on which mintabie sits is leased by the state government from anangu  the original township lease expired in 2002 on 3 december 2009 the south australian parliament passed the anangu pitjantjatjara yankunytjatjara land rights mintabie amendment act 2009 this legislation creates the framework for a new lease the abs 1999 yearbook for south australia states concerning opal mining at mintabie that the opal fields at coober pedy mintabie and andamooka together with fields in
new south wales supply most of the world’s precious opal the estimated value of
raw opal production in south australia was 407m in 1997 most of this is exported
to hong kong japan united states of america and germany the south australian department of primary industry and resources describes mintabies geology as follows the eromanga basin borders onto old basement rocks which are about 1500 million years old and consist of granite and gneiss also on the western margin lie the sediments of the officer basin which comprise sandstone quartzite siltstone and shale about 500 million years old these sediments were tilted by crustal forces and form prominent hills such as the mount johns range near marla the opal deposits at mintabie occur in a sandstone unit which was bleached and weathered by the same process that affected the eromanga basin sediments as described above based upon the climate records of the nearest weather station at marla police station mintabie experiences summer maximum temperatures of an average of 371 degrees celsius in january and a winter maximum average temperature of 197 degrees celsius in june  overnight lows range from a mean minimum temperature of 218 degrees in january to 50 degrees in june annual rainfall averages 2226 millimetres mintabies population is approximately 200250 people  the oacdt states that mintabies population  can fluctuate significantly between the hotter and cooler parts of the year some of the mintabie miners also work claims at the new seven waterholes opal field well to the east the  australian bureau of statistics abs census data showed a fall from 239 residents in the 1996 census to 201 in the 2001 census abs analysis of its 2001 census data showed that mintabie like other south australian mining communities had one of south australias highest proportions of male to female residents 625  mintabie had the highest ratio of lone person households 512 again a characteristic of south australian mining communities  mintabie also recorded one of the states highest unemployment rates 308 second only to iron knob south australia with 328 significantly the indigenous australian population in mintabie is far lower than other parts of the apy lands  the 1991 census found just 21 indigenous people which had decreased to 12 by 1996  hence despite being situated in the apy lands mintabies profile is much more like its sister opal mining communities like roxby downs andamooka and coober pedy the mintabie miners progress association through its promotional website gives the following early history of the area in 1981 anangu won the inalienable freehold title to the apy lands this victory came at the end of protracted and often bitter negotiations as part of those negotiations anangu agreed to lease back to the crown the small parcel of land on which the township of mintabie sits when anangu began their struggle for land rights in 1976 very little prospecting was being conducted at mintabie as things turned out the push for land rights coincided with a rush on opal exploration consequently by the time the south australian parliament began to seriously consider granting land rights to anangu a growing number of opal miners were setting up operations around mintabie in november 1978 a labor government introduced a bill to establish pitjantjatjara land rights before long a group of miners from mintabie had expressed their strong opposition to the bill they warned that the proposed legislation would the bill was still before parliament when a state election was called after the election anangu entered into a fresh round of negotiations with the newly elected liberal government those negotiations concluded on 2 october 1980 when the pitjantjatjara council  acting for all anangu formally reached an agreement with the government on the provisions of a new bill introduced into parliament on 23 october 1980 the pitjantjatjara land rights bill 1980 proposed granting anangu title to a large area of land including the township of mintabie  at the same time the bill recognised that opal mining would continue at mintabie and included provisions to control that activity certain occupancy rights were to be provided to prospectors but these would be balanced with processes that anangu could use if necessary to have someone evicted from mintabie on 25 november 1980 the bill was referred to a select committee in the course of its work the committee visited both mintabie and the anangu community of iwantja in a written submission to the select committee the pitjantjatjara council explained that while it did not wish to interfere with any person who wishes to mine conduct business or otherwise live at or visit mintabie lawfully it had serious concerns about sly grog selling in contrast the opal miners of mintabie  and also some from coober pedy  opposed the bill sometimes vehemently after extensive discussions with both the pitjantjatjara council and the mintabie progress association the parliamentary select committee recommended that the area of land covering the township of mintabie be included in the grant of land to anangu but would be leased back to the crown for a period of 21 years such an arrangement would enable the crown to issue annual licenses to persons entering and wishing to reside at mintabie the committee tabled its report on 3 march 1981 and the bill proceeded through parliament on 2 october 1981 the pitjantjatjara land rights act 1981 came into operation on that day under section 282 of the act the township of mintabie was deemed to have been leased by anangu pitjantjatjara yankunytjatjara to the crown for a term of twentyone years despite long periods of government inattention anangu have repeatedly highlighted the negative impacts that certain individuals and businesses operating out of mintabie have on their lives this has included raising their concerns with representatives of the south australian parliament in october 1987 apy advised a group of parliamentarians visiting the lands that alcohol had become a major problem for anangu communities and that a significant amount was being brought illegally on to the lands through mintabie on that occasion anangu called for south australia police to pay greater attention in mintabie to the sale of alcohol to aborigines 
in 1988 after visiting anangu communities and mintabie a parliamentary committee reported that it had also been advised of ‘grog running by persons apparently using mintabie as the source of supplies and then selling the alcohol at inflated prices to aboriginal people the committee recommended that the matter of alcohol distribution from the mintabie area be investigated urgently by the police more than a decade later significant problems remained in 2002 in a written submission to a parliamentary inquiry iwantja council alleged that many people at mintabie were involved in selling sly grog to anangu the submission continued a month after iwantja made these allegations south australia police sapol confirmed mintabie as the source for a significant amount of the drugs and alcohol coming on to the apy lands on that occasion sapol also reported that it had recently found buried at mintabie a large container set up with hydroponic gear that had been the source of cannabis for much of the lands for the past couple of years
drugs and alcohol continue to enter the apy lands through mintabie in august 2007 south australia police arrested and charged two men at mintabie for their alleged involvement in a cannabis selling network in april 2008 the mullighan inquiry into child sexual abuse on the apy lands noted south australia polices concern that mintabie was being used as a staging post for the trafficking of marijuana on the lands even so coober pedy has been overlooked as a source of alcohol and drugs even though it is only 250 km south of mintabie where only during 2011 a apy citizen was murdered due to alcoholrelated sales in coober pedy also the increase of work on the apy by contractors from marla has also increased the amount of drugs trafficked into the pay lands again no police action has been taken against either coober pedy and marla mintabie has an allweather airstrip schooland 7day supply of fuel and services  accommodation is catered for by the mintabie hotel goanna grill and bar which has 6 rooms 2 selfcontained units and also a 24 hour power caravan park mintabie also has another caravan park the mintabie health clinic called the clarice megaw clinic was opened in 1990 and so named in honour of a bequest from a deceased estate which enabled health authorities to commit more resources to the region this has now been sold by frontier services for an undisclosed amount to a private buyer the mintabie area school is a r12 school with approximately 20 students
by 2009 this had fallen to only 11 enrolments 
mintabie does not have a permanent police presence  south australian police are based at marla and run patrols in the area a permit from the anangu pitjantjatjara yankunytjatjara is required to access mintabie as the land is owned freehold by the resident aboriginal people
currently this isnt being enforced because of unresolved issues for state elections ie to elect the parliament of south australia a mobile polling booth is taken to mintabie native animal species commonly found in and about mintabie include the galah thorny devil and netted dragon lizard and the larger lizard variety known as goanna

in a catholic sense the term saint refers to any spiritually saved person—however since the 10th century the title saint is reserved for those who have been officially recognised by the church for outstanding christian service and conduct in the days when the church of england was in union with rome recognition was in the form of canonisation those martyrs and confessors given the title traditionally prior to the establishment of the canonisation process or since the break with rome are generally still considered both saints and saints the title hero is sometimes used as well more often to refer to those saints who have lived and died since the time of the reformation the provinces of the anglican communion commemorate many of the same saints as those in the roman catholic calendar of saints often on the same days  
in some cases the anglican calendars have retained traditional feasts that the roman catholic church has abolished or moved like the roman catholic church the anglican communion has special holy days in honour of jesus christ the blessed virgin mary and the apostles many of the parishes churches in the communion have the names christ church and st mary the virgin the same can also be said for the four great patrons of great britain and ireland 
saint george patron of england saint david patron of wales saint patrick patron of ireland and saint andrew patron of scotland english and local saints are often emphasized and there are differences between the provinces calendars king charles i of england is the only person to have been treated as a new saint by some anglicans following the english reformation after which he was referred to as a martyr and included briefly in a calendar of the book of common prayer this canonisation is however considered neither universal nor official in the anglican communion worldwide and many national churches list him as a martyr and not a saint or as neither there are several persons commemorated in the modern anglican calendars who were opposed to the roman catholic church of particular note are john wycliffe and william tyndale the last of whom king henry viii had executed by strangulation in belgium for his protestant views for beginning the full translation of the bible into english a project which led to the geneva bible and for writings against the catholic church the oxford martyrs thomas cranmer nicholas ridley and hugh latimer are also commemorated for the courage they showed in death and for their belief in a free church of england in the 19th century a group of anglican and roman catholic converts were martyred together in uganda on 18 october 1964 pope paul vi canonised the 22 ugandan martyrs who were roman catholics anglican churches also commemorate various famous often postreformation christians  the west front of westminster abbey for example contains statues of 20thcentury martyrs like maximilian kolbe martin luther king jr oscar romero dietrich bonhoeffer and lucian tapiedi one of the anglican new guinea martyrs the ninth lambeth conference held in 1958 clarified the commemoration of saints and heroes of the christian church in the anglican communion resolution 79 stated the following have been identified as heroes of the christian church in the anglican communion postreformation individuals commemorated in the church of england calendar excluding those primarily venerated by the roman catholic or orthodox churches

denominations some of which have retained the trademarked cursillo name while others have modified its talksmethods and given it a different name the cursillo focuses on showing christian lay people how to become effective christian leaders over the course of a threeday weekend  the weekend includes fifteen talks some given by priests and some by lay people those talks are called rollos  the major emphasis of the weekend is to ask participants to take what they have learned back into the world on what they call the fourth day  the method stresses personal spiritual development as accelerated by weekly group reunion after the weekend cursillos first appeared in spain in 1944 when the country was under the rule of dictator francisco franco who made spain a quasitheocracy based on the principles of roman catholicism as interpreted by the falange a layman named eduardo bonnín participated in the early years of the short courses in majorca and helped develop the cursillos to the point that it became an active renewal movement in the church  in 1957 the movement had spread to north america when the first  american cursillo was held in waco texas  in 1959 the cursillo spread throughout texas and to phoenix arizona  in august of that year the first national convention of spiritual directors was held and ultreya magazine began publication  in 1960 the growth of the cursillo quickened in the southwest and weekends were held for the first time in the east in new york city and lorain ohio until 1961 all weekends were held in spanish  that year the first englishspeaking weekend was held in san angelo texas  also in 1961 first weekends were held in san francisco california gary indiana lansing michigan guaynabo puerto rico and gallup new mexico  in

the 160 dioceses in the united states had introduced the cursillo movement the cursillo movement in the united states was organized on a national basis in 1965  a national secretariat was formed and the national cursillo office currently in jarrell texas was established  today cursillo is a worldwide movement with centers in nearly all south and central american countries the united states canada

a worldwide international office the omcc organismo mundial de cursillos de cristiandad  this international office is currently located in clayfield qld australia being in colors is to be in gods grace for that reason the cursillo people cursillistas greet saying de colores in colors to each other a story from the early days of the movement in spain tells of an occasion where a group of men were returning from a cursillo weekend when their bus broke down  they began to sing de colores a traditional folk song  the use of the song in cursillo took hold and has held up as the movement has spread outside the spanishspeaking world and to other denominations  the use of a multicolored rooster as a symbol for the cursillo movement is believed to have originated from one of the verses of that song the cursillo is supported by the roman catholic church  it is joined to the united states conference of catholic bishops through an official liaison in the person of eusebio elizondo

apparently the effort impressed sande and howard for stagehands next start was the united states hotel stakes chaps had once before and had no trouble doing it again while stagehand ran fifth under his diehard jockey jack westrope dropped down in class in an effort to get a win after running just five days earlier stagehand finished a troubled fifth yet again sande took westrope off the horse and gave balaski a try stagehand ran a credible but off the board fourth
clearly running at the spa wasnt working so with balaski back up stagehand was entered in another maiden at belmont park the change of tracks did little to help as he finished second to last 17th in a field of 18 what howard was thinking when he entered him in an allowance just 8 days later is unknown as stagehand resumed his string of 5th place finishes howard remained strong however and entered stagehand in a 7 furlong maiden the extra distance was all he needed stagehand finished third by a nose to alps bonnie sea who finished second was taken down due to her severe bumping as stagehand came up the inside 
shipped to santa anita for the winter meet stagehand was entered in a mile event for maidens on new years day going 7 furlongs gipsy minstrel won handily but stagehand relished the distance and looked like a whole new horse after 2 months off as he finished a closing second stagehands record for the season was 8 0  1  2 retired to stud duty he had modest success as the sire of several stakes race winners his last foal was born in 1953

a bottle of italian olive oil olive oil is a fat obtained from the olive the fruit of olea europaea family oleaceae a traditional tree crop of the mediterranean basin the oil is produced by pressing whole olives it is commonly used in cooking cosmetics pharmaceuticals and soaps and as a fuel for traditional oil lamps olive oil is used throughout the world but especially in the mediterranean countries and in particular in greece which has the highest consumption per person the olive tree is native to the mediterranean basin wild olives were collected by neolithic peoples as early as the 8th millennium bc the wild olive tree originated in asia minor or in ancient greece it is not clear when and where olive trees were first domesticated in asia minor in the 6th millennium along the levantine coast stretching from the sinai peninsula to modern turkey in the 4th millennium or somewhere in the mesopotamian fertile crescent in the 3rd millennium a widespread view exists that the first cultivation took place on the island of crete archeological evidence suggest that olives were being grown in crete as long ago as 2500 bc the earliest surviving olive oil amphorae date to 3500 bc early minoan times though the production of olive is assumed to have started before 4000 bc an alternative view retains that olives were turned into oil by 4500 bc by canaanites in presentday israel until 1500 bc eastern coastal areas of the mediterranean were most heavily cultivated olive trees were certainly cultivated by the late minoan period 1500 bc in crete and perhaps as early as the early minoan the cultivation of olive trees in crete became particularly intense in the postpalatial period and played an important role in the islands economy recent genetic studies suggest that species used by modern cultivators descend from multiple wild populations but a detailed history of domestication is not yet understood olive trees and oil production in the eastern mediterranean can be traced to archives of the ancient citystate ebla 2600–2240 bc which were located on the outskirts of the syrian city aleppo here some dozen documents dated 2400 bc describe lands of the king and the queen these belonged to a library of clay tablets perfectly preserved by having been baked in the fire that destroyed the palace a later source is the frequent mentions of oil in tanakhcitation needed dynastic egyptians before 2000 bc imported olive oil from crete syria and canaan and oil was an important item of commerce and wealth remains of olive oil have been found in jugs over 4000 years old in a tomb on the island of naxos in the aegean sea sinuhe the egyptian exile who lived in northern canaan about 1960 bc wrote of abundant olive trees besides food olive oil has been used for religious rituals medicines as a fuel in oil lamps soapmaking and skin care application the minoans used olive oil in religious ceremonies the oil became a principal product of the minoan civilization where it is thought to have represented wealth the minoans put the pulp into settling tanks and when the oil had risen to the top drained the water from the bottomcitation needed olive tree growing reached iberia and etruscan cities well before the 8th century bc through trade with the phoenicians and carthage then was spread into southern gaul by the celtic tribes during the 7th century bc the first recorded oil extraction is known from the hebrew bible and took place during the exodus from egypt during the 13th century bc during this time the oil was derived through handsqueezing the berries and stored in special containers under guard of the priests a commercial mill for nonsacramental use of oil was in use in the tribal confederation and later in 1000 bc the fertile crescent an area consisting of present day palestine lebanon and israel over 100 olive presses have been found in tel miqne ekron where the biblical philistines also produced oil these presses are estimated to have had output of between 1000 and 3000 tons of olive oil per season many ancient presses still exist in the eastern mediterranean region and some dating to the roman period are still in use todaycitation needed olive oil was common in ancient greek and roman cuisine according to herodotus apollodorus plutarch pausanias ovid and other sources the city of athens obtained its name because athenians considered olive oil essential preferring the offering of the goddess athena an olive tree over the offering of poseidon a spring of salt water gushing out of a cliff the spartans and other greeks used oil to rub themselves while exercising in the gymnasia from its beginnings early in the 7th century bc the cosmetic use of olive oil quickly spread to all of hellenic city states together with athletes training in the nude and lasted close to a thousand years despite its great expense olive trees were planted in the entire mediterranean basin during evolution of the roman republic and empire according to the historian pliny italy had excellent olive oil at reasonable prices by the 1st century ad the best in the mediterranean he maintained the importance and antiquity of olive oil can be seen in the fact that the english word oil derives from c 1175 olive oil from anglofr and onfr olie from ofr oile 12c modfr huile from l oleum oil olive oil cf it olio from gk elaion olive tree which may have been borrowed through trade networks from the semitic phoenician use of elyon meaning superior probably in recognized comparison to other vegetable or animal fats available at the time robin lane fox suggests that the latin borrowing of greek elaion for oil latin oleum is itself a marker for improved greek varieties of oilproducing olive already present in italy as latin was forming brought by euboean traders whose presence in latium is signaled by remains of their characteristic pottery from the mid8th century there are many different olive varieties or olives each with a particular flavor texture and shelflife that make them more or less suitable for different applications such as direct human consumption on bread or in salads indirect consumption in domestic cooking or catering or industrial uses such as animal feed or engineering applicationscitation needed spain produces 438 of world production of olive oil 75 of spains production comes from the region of andalucía particularly within jaén province although other regions including catalonia also produce excellent oil although italy is a net importer of olive oil it still accounts for 215 of the worlds production major italian producers are known as città dellolio oil cities including lucca florence and siena in tuscany however the largest production is harvested in puglia and calabria greece accounts for 121 of world production and syria for 61 as third and fourth largest producers in the world  portugal accounts for 5 and its main export market is brazil morocco is the worlds sixth largest producer australia now produces a substantial amount of olive oil many australian producers only make premium oils while a number of corporate growers operate groves of a million trees or more and produce oils for the general market australian olive oil is exported to asia europe and the united states in north america italian and spanish olive oils are the bestknown and topquality extravirgin oils from italy spain portugal and greece are sold at high prices often in prestige packaging a large part of us olive oil imports come from italy spain and turkey the us imported 47800000 us gallons 181000 m3 of olive oil in 1998 of which 34600000 us gallons 131000 m3 came from italy turkey new zealand the republic of south africa argentina and chile also produce extra virgin olive oil olive orchards in arizona california and texas are producing olive oil that is appearing on usa grocery market shelves alongside the mediterranean olive oilscitation needed olive oil is classified by how it was produced by its chemistry and by panels that perform olive oil taste testing the international olive council ioc — an intergovernmental organization based in madrid spain with 16 member states plus the european union — promotes olive oil around the world by tracking production defining quality standards and monitoring authenticity the ioc officially governs 95 of international production and holds great influence over the rest the eu regulates the use of different protected designation of origin labels for olive oils the united states is not a member of the ioc and is not subject to its authority but on october 25 2010 the us department of agriculture adopted new voluntary olive oil grading standards that closely parallel those of the ioc with some adjustments for the characteristics of olives grown in the us additionally us customs regulations on country of origin state that if a nonorigin nation is shown on the label then the real origin must be shown on the same side of the label and in comparable size letters so as not to mislead the consumer yet most major us brands continue to put imported from italy on the front label in large letters and other origins on the back in very small print in fact olive oil labeled italian often comes from turkey tunisia morocco spain and greece this makes it unclear what percentage of the olive oil is really of italian origin this practice makes it difficult for high quality lower cost producers outside of italy to enter the us market and for genuine italian producers to compete all production begins by transforming the olive fruit into olive paste by crushing or pressing this paste is then malaxed slowly churned or mixed to allow the microscopic oil droplets to agglomerate the oil is then separated from the watery matter and fruit pulp with the use of a press traditional method or centrifugation modern method after extraction the remnant solid substance called pomace still contains a small quantity of oil the grades of oil extracted from the olive fruit can be classified as in countries that adhere to the standards of the international olive council ioc as well as in australia and under the voluntary usda labeling standards in the united states as the united states is not a member the ioc retail grades have no legal meaning in that country but as of october 25 2010 the usda established new standards for grades of olive oil and olivepomace oil which closely parallel the ioc standards these grades are voluntary certification is available from the usda on a feeforservice basis quantitative analysis can determine the oils acidity which refers not to its chemical acidity in the sense of ph but as the percent measured by weight of free oleic acid this is a measure of the hydrolysis of the oils triglycerides as the oil degrades more fatty acids are freed from the glycerides increasing the level of free acidity and thereby increasing hydrolytic rancidity another measure of the oils chemical degradation is the peroxide value which measures the degree to which the oil is oxidized damaged by free radicals leading to oxidative rancidity to classify it by taste olive oil is judged by a panel of trained tasters in a blind taste test this is also called its organoleptic quality the adulteration of oil can be no more serious than passing off inferior but safe product as superior olive oil but there are no guarantees it is believed that almost 700 people died in 1981 as a consequence of consuming rapeseed oil adulterated with aniline intended for use as an industrial lubricant but sold as olive oil in spain see toxic oil syndrome there have been allegations that regulation particularly in italy and spain is extremely lax and corrupt major shippers are claimed to routinely adulterate olive oil and that only about 40 of olive oil sold as extra virgin in italy actually meets the specification in some cases colza oil swedish turnip with added color and flavor has been labeled and sold as olive oil this extensive fraud prompted the italian government to mandate a new labeling law in 2007 for companies selling olive oil under which every bottle of italian olive oil would have to declare the farm and press on which it was produced as well as display a precise breakdown of the oils used for blended oils in february 2008 however eu officials took issue with the new law stating that under eu rules such labeling should be voluntary rather than compulsory under eu rules olive oil may be sold as italian even if it only contains a small amount of italian oil extra virgin olive oil has strict requirements and is checked for sensory defects that include rancid fusty musty winey vinegary and muddy sediment these defects can occur for different reasons the most common are in march 2008 400 italian police officers conducted operation golden oil arresting 23 people and confiscating 85 farms after an investigation revealed a largescale scheme to relabel oils from other mediterranean nations as italian in april 2008 another operation impounded seven olive oil plants and arrested 40 people in nine provinces of northern and southern italy for adding chlorophyll to sunflower and soybean oil and selling it as extra virgin olive oil both in italy and abroad 25000 liters of the fake oil were seized and prevented from being exported on march 15 2011 the florence italy prosecutors office working in conjunction with the forestry department indicted two managers and an officer of carapelli one of the brands of the spanish company grupo sos which recently changed its name to deoleo the charges involved falsified documents and food fraud carapelli lawyer neri pinucci said the company was not worried about the charges and that the case is based on an irregularity in the documents in february 2012 an alleged international olive oil scam occurred in which palm avocado sunflower and other cheaper oils were passed off as olive oil spanish police said the oils were blended in an industrial biodiesel plant and adulterated in a way to hide markers that would have revealed their true nature the oils were not toxic however and posed no health risk according to a statement by the guardia civil nineteen people were arrested following the yearlong joint probe by the police and spanish tax authorities part of what they call operation lucerna greece has by far the largest per capita consumption of olive oil worldwide over 26 liters per person per year spain and italy around 14 l tunisia portugal syria jordan and lebanon around 8 l northern europe and north america consume far less around 07 l but the consumption of olive oil outside its home territory has been rising steadily the main producing and consuming countries are olive oil is produced by grinding olives and extracting the oil by mechanical or chemical means green olives usually produce more bitter oil and overripe olives can produce oil that is rancid so for good extra virgin olive oil care is taken to make sure the olives are perfectly ripened the process is generally as follows the remaining paste pomace still contains a small quantity about 5–10 of oil that cannot be extracted by further pressing but only with chemical solvents this is done in specialised chemical plants not in the oil mills the resulting oil is not virgin but pomace oil the term first press sometimes found on bottle labels is today meaningless as there is no second press it comes from ancient times of stone presses when virgin oil was the one produced by battering the olives the label term coldextraction on extra virgin olive oils indicates that the olive grinding and stirring was done at a temperature of maximum 25 °c 77 °f as treatment in higher temperatures risks decreasing the olive oils quality texture taste and aroma olive oil is composed mainly of the mixed triglyceride esters of oleic acid and palmitic acid and of other fatty acids along with traces of squalene up to 07 and sterols about 02 phytosterol and tocosterols the composition varies by cultivar region altitude time of harvest and extraction process olive oil contains polyphenols such as esters of tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol including oleocanthal and oleuropein having acidic properties that give extravirgin unprocessed olive oil its bitter and pungent taste olive oil is a source of at least 30 phenolic compounds other phenolic constituents include aldehydic secoiridoids flavonoids and lignans acetoxypinoresinol pinoresinol the latter two compounds are only present in extra virgin oil hydroxytyrosol 234dihydroxyphenylethanol or dhpe is a phenolic component of extravirgin olive oil an olive oil fraction containing dhpe was shown to inhibit platelet aggregation and eicosanoid thromboxane b2 formation in vitro  both hydroxytyrosol and its precursor oleuropein exist in the fruit at levels on the order of 100 times that of shelf extra virgin olive oil  phenolics are considerably higher in fresh cloudy olive oil than extra virgin that has been separated and aged oleocanthal from olive oil is a nonselective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase cox similar to classical nsaids like ibuprofen it has been suggested that longterm consumption of small quantities of this compound from olive oil may be responsible in part for the low incidence of heart disease associated with a mediterranean diet as they are the least processed forms of olive oil extra virgin or virgin olive oil have more monounsaturated fatty acids than other olive oil these types also contain more polyphenols which may have benefits for the heart one tablespoon of olive oil 135g contains the following nutritional information according to the usda olive oil has a long history of being used as a home remedy for  skincare egyptians used it alongside beeswax as a cleanser moisturizer and antibacterial agent since pharaonic times in ancient greece the substance was used during massage to prevent sports injuries relieve muscle fatigue and eliminate lactic acid buildup in 2000 japan was the top importer of olive oil in asia 13000 tons annually because consumers there believe both the ingestion and topical application of olive oil to be good for skin and health there has been relatively little scientific work done on the effect of olive oil on acne and other skin conditions however one study noted that the abundance of squalene in oils in general shows promise for sufferers of seborrheic dermatitis acne psoriasis and atopic dermatitis squalene is used as an antioxidant moisturizer and as a convenient vehicle to carry other substances in topical application another researcher reported that a mixture of honey beeswax and olive oil alleviates diaper dermatitis psoriasis and eczema by inhibiting the growth of staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans olive oil is popular for use in massaging infants and toddlers but scientific proof of its efficacy is mixed one analysis of olive oil versus mineral oil found that when used for infant massage olive oil can be considered a safe alternative to sunflower grapeseed and fractionated coconut oils this stands true particularly when it is mixed with a lighter oil like sunflower which would have the further effect of reducing the already low levels of free fatty acids present in olive oil the study also notes that there appears to be much confusion surrounding mineral oil and that further studies should be done on refined mineral oil to back up claims about its superiority to olive oil another trial echoes this claim stating that olive oil lowers the risk of dermatitis for infants in all gestational stages when compared with emollient cream however yet another study found that topical treatment with olive oil for newborns significantly damages the skin barrier when compared to sunflower oil and that it may make existing atopic dermatitis worse the researchers conclude that they do not recommend the use of olive oil for the treatment of dry skin and infant massage clinical trials have found that olive oil does not act to prevent or reduce stretch marks the fatty substance was found to reduce inflammation via oleuropein which is touted for its antioxidant antiatherosclerotic and antiinflammatory characteristics preliminary clinical studies provide evidence that consumption of olive oil may lower risk of heart disease risk factors such as lower blood cholesterol levels and reduced ldl cholesterol oxidation and that it may also possibly influence inflammatory thrombotic hypertensive and vasodilatory mechanisms although epidemiological studies indicate that a higher proportion of monounsaturated fats in the diet may be linked with a reduction in the risk of coronary heart disease a cause and effect relationship has not yet been established with sufficient scientific evidence in the united states producers of olive oil may place the following restricted health claim on product labels this decision was announced november 1 2004 by the food and drug administration after application was made to the fda by producers similar labels are permitted for foods rich in omega3 fatty acids such as walnuts and hemp seed other possible effects of olive oil may be a property to balance omega6 fats and omega3 fatscitation needed and to affect blood sugar levels and blood pressure but these effects were dismissed in reviews by the scientific committee of the european food safety authority olive oil contains the monounsaturated fatty acid oleic acid vitamin e and oleuropein a chemical that may affect the oxidation of ldl particles preliminary research indicates that olive oil could possibly be a chemopreventive agent for peptic ulcer or gastric cancer but confirmation requires further in vivo study pilot studies showed that olive oil may reduce oxidative damage to dna and rna revealing a possible anticarcinogenic factor consumption of olive oil may prevent the onset of alzheimers disease possibly through a mechanism related to oleocanthal inhibiting fibrillization of tau protein olive oil is the main cooking oil in countries surrounding the mediterranean sea extra virgin olive oil is mostly used as a salad dressing and as an ingredient in salad dressings it is also used with foods to be eaten cold if uncompromised by heat the flavor is stronger it also can be used for sautéing the higher the temperature to which the olive oil is heated the higher the risk of compromising its taste when extra virgin olive oil is heated above 210–216 °c 410–421 °f depending on its free fatty acid content the unrefined particles within the oil are burned this leads to deteriorated taste also the pronounced taste of extra virgin olive oil is not a taste most people like to associate with their deep fried foods refined olive oils are perfectly suited for deep frying foods and should be replaced after several usescitation needed choosing a coldpressed olive oil can be similar to selecting a wine the flavor of these oils varies considerably and a particular oil may be more suited for a particular dish also people who like lots of tannins in their red wines might prefer more bitter olive oils an important issue often not realized in countries that do not produce olive oil is that the freshness makes a big difference a very fresh oil as available in an oil producing region tastes noticeably different from the older oils available elsewhere in time oils deteriorate and become stale oneyear old oil may be still pleasant to the taste but it is surely less fragrant than fresh oil after the first year olive oil should be used for cooking not for foods to be eaten cold like salads the taste of the olive oil is influenced by the varietals used to produce the oil from and by the moment when the olives are harvested and ground less ripe olives give more bitter and spicy flavors  riper olives give a sweeter sensation in the oil for certain culinary uses olive oil may be substituted with safflower or sunflower oils canola oil peanut oil sesame oil or coconut oil olive oil has various nonculinary uses as well for example it is also a natural and safe lubricant and can be used to lubricate machinery that is used within the kitchen grinders blenders cookware etc it can also be used for illumination oil lamps or as the base for soaps and detergents some cosmetics also use olive oil as their base olive oil also has religious symbolism for healing and strength and to consecration—gods setting a person or place apart for special work this may be related to its ancient use as a medicinal agent and for cleansing athletes by slathering them in oil then scraping them in jewish observance olive oil is the only fuel allowed to be used in the sevenbranched menorah in the mishkan service during the exodus of the tribes of israel from egypt and later in the permanent temple in jerusalem it was obtained by using only the first drop from a squeezed olive and was consecrated for use only in the temple by the priests and stored in special containers a menorah similar to the menorah used in the mishkan is now used during the holiday of hanukkah that celebrates the miracle of the last of such containers being found during the rededication of the temple 163 bc when its contents lasted for far longer than they were expected to allowing more time for more oil to be made although candles can be used to light the hanukkiah oil containers are preferred to imitate the original menorah another use of oil in jewish religion is for anointing the kings of the kingdom of israel originating from king david tzidkiyahu was the last anointed king of israel the catholic and orthodox churches use olive oil for the oil of catechumens used to bless and strengthen those preparing for baptism and oil of the sick used to confer the sacrament of anointing of the sick or unction olive oil mixed with a perfuming agent such as balsam is consecrated by bishops as sacred chrism which is used to confer the sacrament of confirmation as a symbol of the strengthening of the holy spirit in the rites of baptism and the ordination of priests and bishops in the consecration of altars and churches and traditionally in the anointing of monarchs at their coronation the church of jesus christ of latterday saints mormons and a number of other religions use olive oil when they need to consecrate an oil for anointings eastern orthodox christians still use oil lamps in their churches home prayer corners and in the cemeteries a vigil lamp consists of a votive glass containing a halfinch of water and filled the rest with olive oil the glass has a metal holder that hangs from a bracket on the wall or sits on a table a cork float with a lit wick floats on the oil to douse the flame the float is carefully pressed down into the oil makeshift oil lamps can easily be made by soaking a ball of cotton in olive oil and forming it into a peak the peak is lit and then burns until all the oil is consumed whereupon the rest of the cotton burns out olive oil is a usual offering to churches and cemeteries in the orthodox church olive oil is a product not consumed during lent or penance while orthodox monks use it sparingly in their diet exceptions are in feast days and sundays in islam olive oil is mentioned in the quranic verse god is the light of the heavens and the earth an example of his light is like a lantern inside which there is a torch the torch is in a glass bulb the glass bulb is like a bright planet lit by a blessed olive tree neither eastern nor western its oil almost glows even without fire touching it light upon light the quran also mentions olives as a plant of significance by the fig and the olive and the mount sinai and this secure city olive oil is also reported to have been recommended by prophet muhammad in the following terms consume olive oil and anoint it upon your bodies since it is of the blessed tree

the title of king of the wends denoted sovereignty or claims over onceslavic lands of southern coasts of the baltic sea those otherwise called mecklenburg holstein and pomerania and was used from 12th century to 1972 by kings of denmark and from ca 1540 to 1973 by the kings of sweden the generally accepted interpretation is that the word refers to the wends a slavic people that lived on the south shores of the baltic sea although the situation is further complicated by the existence of the vends located between the finns and the wends and with somewhat unknown origin the titles one poetic explanation also was kingship over the antique people of the vandals vandalorum rex but that idea came only in 16th century a recent interpretation not much supported in academic research has been made that the part vend in the later established titles of the kings of sweden three kingdoms king of the svear götar and vends svears göters och venders konung means finland the form presumably being akin to vindlandcitation needed as such the österland—the medieval name for the finnish part of the swedish kingdom—was the third part of the realm however only forty years after the adoption of the title king of the wends began the swedish kings to style themselves as grand prince of finland as well kings of denmark bore the title for eight centuries after it was first adopted by king canute vi reigned 1182 to 1202 who conquered the lands of the wends in pomerania and mecklenburg in germanic languages the name was wends and in medieval documentation the latin name was sclavorum rex referring to the slavic peoples in and around the region now known as mecklenburg in 16th century latin sclavorum was changed to vandalorum also by danish kings showing the new poetic idea the danish kings continued to use the title over the next seven hundred years until 1972 when queen margrethe ii succeeded she abandoned the use of all the royal titles except for that of denmarks kingqueen which is the royal style today when sweden had made its final breakaway from the kalmar union that united it with norway and denmark tensions between the two rulers were high and it showed also in their flags coatofarms and titles gustav i of sweden adopted c 1540 the third kingdom to his titles which hitherto had only included swedes and goths he took vandalorumque rex venders konung as the third name of the list of kingships svears göters och venders konung was used in official documentation up to the accession of charles xvi gustav of sweden in 1973 who was the first proclaimed officially sveriges konung king of sweden and nothing else

 saray mulk khanum c 1343 – 1406 was the great or grand empress of the timurid empire as the chief consort of timur also known as tamerlane the great the founder of the timurid empire as well as the timurid dynasty by birth she was a princess of the chagatai khanate as a daughter of qazan khan ibn yasaur and was a member of the house of borjigin the most renowned family clan in eurasia she was also a descendant of genghis khan saray mulk khanum was born a princess of the chagatai khanate in c 1343 to qazan khan ibn yasaur the last  khan of the chagatai khanate sarays grandfather was khan yasaur her fathers predecessor and a greatgreatgrandson of chagatai khan she was therefore a direct descendant of genghis khan the great khan emperor and founder of the mongol empire by birth saray was also a member of the house of borjigin the most renowned family clan in eurasia being the daughter of a khan saray held the title of khanum daughter of a khan or princess by birth before her marriage to timur saray had been previously married to her husbands predecessor amir husayn of balkh when in 1370 timur defeated and thereafter executed husayn after the siege of balkh he seized the harem of his predecessor and took to himself the latters wives one of whom was saray mulk khanum daughter of khan qazan and a turkomongol princess saray was five years younger than timur as the daughter of a khan and a descendant of genghis khan saray enjoyed the status of timurs senior wife although in her first husbands harem the chief wife was a daughter of khan tarmashirin who after husayns fall was married to the jalayir khan bahram through his marriage to saray timur acquired the right to the surname gurgan soninlaw of qazan khan which figures on his coins and appears very often in the mamluk sources the title of gurgan was very important for timur because it was vindictive of his relations with the family of the chughtai in 1397 timur married tukalkhanum a daughter of the mongol khan khizr khoja who skipped over several other wives due to her exalted lineage and took the second place in the harem becoming second in status only to saray saray therefore held the position of being timurs chief consort until his death little is known of saray and timurs relationship apart from the fact that she was his confidante and one of his closest advisers but it is clear that she wielded great influence in the empire and over her husband she is also cited by all sources to have been timurs favourite and his beloved wife saray also sometimes acted as regent during timurs absences from samarkand as a result of his western campaigns and wielded great authority at court as timurs chief consort saray additionally held the title of great empress similar to the title held by genghis khans chief wife borte the spanish ambassador ruy gonzáles de clavijo who was sent by henry iii of castile to visit timurs court in 1405 called saray the grand khanum in appearance saray was said to be very beautiful and sometimes described as possessing surpassing beauty she did not have any children with timur though she is sometimes referred to as the mother of her husbands youngest son shahrukh mirza who was actually born of a concubine even if saray had any children with her husband they did not survive and neither did tukalkhanums and yet their power and influence were well noted by foreign visitors to the court it was the two chingisid princesses personal qualities and pedigree that allowed them to develop a prestigious dynastic position since with timurid consorts maternity was not in itself a path to power nonetheless upon the birth of shahrukhs eldest son ulugh beg in 1394 he was placed in sarays care and grew up under the supervision of the empress in may 1394 saray along with timurs other wives followed her husband with the ughruq to armenia and transcaucasia where ibrahim was born in september they returned to sultaniya but some time later were again summoned to join timur in the spring of 1395 both the saray and tukal with the children were sent to samarkand where shahrukh had been staying since the autumn of 1394 in 1396 they were all in khuzar meeting timur on his return from his five years campaign during the indian campaign saray mulk khanum and ulugh accompanied timur only as far as kabul in august 1398 timur sent them back to samarkand from the neighbourhood of kabul although the spanish ambassador ruy gonzáles de clavijo probably did not intend it his description of cano the great khanum timurs chief wife as she entered the great pavilion serves as a potent metaphor for much that he witnessed during his sojourn in samarkand the capital of timurid empire between 8 september and 20 november 1404 as the ambassador of henry iii of castile clavijo enjoyed great generous access to the life and ceremony of the timurid imperial court and left one of the most detailed and lengthy accounts of their settings cano identifiable as empress saray had come to join her husband timur for a great feast one of the several arranged at the khanigil lit mine of clay meadow located outside samarkand clavijo offers an expanded description of sarays procession into the pavilion and of what she was wearing joined by fifteen servants to carry her train eunuchs and a male servant carrying a shade sombra saray mulk khanum was dressed in red silk her face covered by a white veil she wore a complex headdress fashioned from red fabric ornamented with pearls rubies turquoise feathers and held together with gold wire clavijo estimated about 300 hundred attendants making up her royal suite her doublyscreened face — one screen a cloth veil the other a thick layer of applied makeup — concealed her true identity the face that dimly showed beneath her veil was so thickly covered with white lead put on for protection from the sun that it looked as if it was made of paper one of the most important buildings of the late 14th century in samarkand was the khanum madrasa opposite the great mosque of timur the madrasa was commissioned by empress saray in c 1397 as she was interested in patronizing education and was built by her orders at the capital of the timurid empire samarkand saray had commissioned many other buildings but only the khanum madrasa remains intact to this day

fusiliers is a name given to various kinds of soldiers its meaning depends upon on the historical context while fusilier is derived from the 17th century french word fusil – meaning a type of flintlock musket –  the term has been used in contrasting ways in different countries and at different times including soldiers guarding artillery various elite units ordinary line infantry and other uses the term fusiliers was first used officially by the french army in 1670 when four fusiliers were distributed amongst each company of infantry the following year the fusiliers du roi kings fusiliers the first regiment composed primarily of soldiers with flintlocks was formed by sébastien le prestre de vauban guarding and escorting artillery pieces was the first task assigned to the fusiliers du roi flintlocks were especially useful around field artillery as they were less likely than matchlocks to accidentally ignite open barrels of gunpowder required at the time to load cannons at the time artillery units also required guards to maintain discipline amongst civilian draymen hence the term fusilier became strongly associated with the role of guarding artillery in britain and the englishspeaking world especially after the formation of the first official fusilier units during the 1680s during the 18th century as flintlocks became the main weapon used by infantry the term fusilier gradually ceased to have this meaning and was applied to various units by the mid18th century the french army used the term fusiliers to designate ordinary line infantry as opposed to specialist or élite infantry such as grenadiers voltigeurs carabiniers or chasseurs the french army no longer uses the term fusiliers although a number of its infantry regiments descend from fusilier regiments however the french navy and french air force continue to use the word fusiliers marins naval fusiliers is the name given to the navys marines whilst fusiliers commandos de lair air fusilier commandos are the ground infantry units of the air force – other than airborneparachute units the original fusiliers in the british army were the 7th foot royal regiment of fuzileers raised in 1685 this subsequently became the royal fusiliers city of london regiment the original purpose of this unit was to act as escort to artillery guns as well as keeping discipline amongst the civilian drivers  both a scots 21st foot and welsh 23rd foot regiment also became fusiliers in the period up to and including 1702 and all three regiments were distinguished by the wearing of a slightly shorter version of the mitred cap worn by grenadier companies of all other infantry regiments  a number of additional infantry regiments were subsequently designated as fusiliers during the 19th century but this was simply a historic distinction without any relationship to special weapons or roles in 1865 a distinctive headdress was authorised for british army fusilier regiments for other ranks this was a raccoon skin cap fusilier officers however wore a taller bearskin like their counterparts in the foot guards the badge for each regiment was placed at the front of the bear or raccoon skin headdress  and consisted of a stylized flaming grenade with different emblems placed on the ball of the grenade attached to the various types of fusilier headdress including the modern beret is the hackle this is a short cut feather plume the colour or colours of which varied according to the regiment initially the only regiment authorised to wear a plume or hackle were the 5th foot or northumberland fusiliers the regiment had originally worn a white feather distinction authorised in 1824 to commemorate the victory of st lucia in 1778 when men of the fifth regiment were supposed to have taken white feathers from the hats of fallen french soldiers when in 1829 a white plume was ordered for all line infantry regiments to preserve the fifth northumberland regiments emblem they were authorised to wear a white plume with a red tip allegedly to indicate a distinction won in battle the fifth were designated fusiliers in 1836 following the second boer war plumes were added to the headgear of all fusilier regiments in recognition of their service in south africa the following fusilier regiments existed prior to the outbreak of world war i the nine regiments of fusiliers that existed in 1914 have since been reduced to one by a series of disbandments and mergers in addition the scots guards were known as the scots fusilier guards from 1831 to 1877 there are five fusilier regiments patterned on the british tradition forming part of the militia parttime reserve of the canadian forces the royal 22e régiment although not fusiliers wears fusilier ceremonial uniform with scarlet plumes because of its alliance with the royal welch fusiliers prussia made early use of the title fusilier for various types of infantry in 1705 the foot guards leibgarde zu fuss were designated as fusilier guards by 1837 lowquality infantry raised from garrison companies also were named fusiliers these latter units were dressed in blue with low mitre caps see  between 1740 and 1743 on frederick the great raised 14 separate fusilier regiments numbers 3340 4143 and 4548 except for the mitre caps these new regiments were identical in appearance training and role to the existing line infantry musketeers subsequently prussia and several other german states used the designation fusilier to denote a type of light infantry dressed in green that acted as skirmishers in the prussian army they had been formed in 1787 as independent battalions with many of the officers having had experience in the american revolutionary war the prussian reforms of 1808 absorbed the fusiliers as the third battalion of each line infantry regiment now wearing blue uniforms they were distinguished by black leather belts and a slightly different arrangement of cartridge pouch in the prussian army of 1870 infantry regiments 33 to 40 plus regiments 73 hanover 80 hessekassel or hessecassel and 86 schleswigholstein were all designated as fusiliers as was the guard fusilier regiment in addition the third battalions of all guard grenadier and line infantry regiments retained the designation fusilier battalion they were armed with a slightly shorter version of the dreyse rifle füsiliergewehr that took a sword bayonet füsilierseitengewehr rather than the standard socket bayonet although still theoretically skirmishers in practice they differed little from their compatriots as all prussian infantry fought in a style that formed a dense firing or skirmish line by the 1880s the title was honorific and while implying specialist or elite did not have any tactical significance in a sense all infantry were becoming fusiliers as weapons tactics and equipment took on the fusilier characteristics  that is skirmish line shorter rifles sword bayonets and black leather equipment nonetheless these titular units remained in existence until the end of the german imperial army in 1918 as follows in addition there was the following regiment this was a special case as it was also classed as schützen sharpshooter this designation originally signified a type of jäger rifleman and thus the regiment wore the jägerstyle dark green uniform the various fusilier regiments and battalions in the german imperial army of 1914 did not have any single distinctions of dress or equipment to distinguish them as fusiliers individual regiments did however have special features worn with the dark blue full dress some of these features were maintained on the field grey dress of the trenches right up to 1918 as examples in full dress the guard fusiliers had nickel buttons and yellow shoulder straps and the 80th fusiliers special braiding on collars and cuffs deriving from their origin as the elector of hesses guards when a regiment was permitted the distinction of a horsehair plume on the pickelhaube for fusiliers it was always black this included the third fusilier battalion of those regiments normally distinguished by a white horsehair plume in world war ii the elite german division großdeutschland contained a regiment titled panzerfüsiliere armoured fusiliers to maintain the old german traditions this was again titular as in organisation appearance and tactical use they were essentially panzergrenadiere the modern german army has no fusiliers in the royal netherlands army one of the two foot guards regiments the garderegiment fuseliers prinses irene is a regiment of fusiliers the belgian army has no specific regiment called fusiliers but the general denomination for infantry soldiers is storm fusilier dutch stormfuselier french fusilier dassaut the belgian navy used to have a regiment of marine infantry composed of marine fusiliers in charge of the protection of the naval bases however this unit was disbanded in the 1990s reforms  from the 18th to the 19th centuries the term fuzileiros fusiliers was used in the portuguese army to designate the regular line infantry as opposed to the grenadiers granadeiros and the light infantry caçadores and atiradores the portuguese army discontinued the use of the term in the 1860s but the brazilian army continues to use it today to designate all infantry soldiers the term fuzileiros marinheiros fusilier sailors was used in the portuguese navy since the late 18th century to designate the naval infantry presently both the portuguese and the brazilian marine corps are called fuzileiros navais naval fusiliers on 1 january 1969 the mexican army created the parachute fusilier brigade brigada de fusileros paracaidistas with two infantry and one training battalions the brigades role is that of a strategic reserve based in mexico city line infantry soldiers of the lowest rank in the swiss army have historically been designated as fusiliers because the modern swiss infantry soldier is trained in a much broader variety of tasks than his historical counterpart and because of some negative connotations attached to the term füsiliere modern infantry battalions of the swiss army have been renamed infanteriebattalione or infbat the individual soldiers are officially called infanteristen not füsiliere but colloquially they are still referred to as füsiliere or füsle

erlanger v new sombrero phosphate co 1878 3 app cas 1218 is a landmark english contract law restitution and uk company law case it concerned rescission for misrepresentation and how the impossibility of counter restitution may be a bar to rescission it is also an important illustration of how promoters of a company stand in a fiduciary relationship to subscribers emile erlanger was a parisian banker he bought the lease of the anguilla island of sombrero for phosphate mining for £55000 he then set up the new sombrero phosphate co eight days after incorporation he sold the island to the company for £110000 through a nominee one of the directors was the lord mayor of london who himself was independent of the syndicate that formed the company two other directors were abroad and the others were mere puppet directors of erlanger the board which was effectively erlanger ratified the sale of the lease erlanger through promotion and advertising got many members of the public to invest in the company after eight months the public investors found out the fact that erlanger and his syndicate had bought the island at half the price the company now with their money had paid for it the new sombrero phosphate co sued for rescission based on nondisclosure if they gave back the mine and an account of profits or for the difference the house of lords unanimously held that promoters of a company stand in a fiduciary relationship to investors meaning they have a duty of disclosure further they held by majority lord cairns lc dissenting that the contract could be rescinded and that  rescission was not barred by laches lord blackburn decided that delay did not bar rescission as a general condition to a rescission there must be a restitutio in integrum there was a question over this since phosphate had been mined and it was not so easy to put the phosphate back he observed it would be obviously unjust that a person who has been in possession of property under the contract which he seeks to repudiate should be allowed to throw that back on the other party’s hands without accounting for any benefit he may have derived from the use of the property… or making compensation for that deterioration in this case however adequate compensate could be paid so there was no impossibility in counter restitution his judgment ran as follows neither does this act in terms impose any duty on those promoters to have regard to the interests of the company which they are thus empowered to create but it gives them an almost unlimited power to make the corporation subject to such regulations as they please and for such purposes as they please and to create it with a managing body whom they select having powers such as they choose to give to those managers so that the promoters can create such a corporation that the corporation as soon as it comes into being may be bound by anything not in itself illegal which those promoters have chosen and i think those who accept and use such extensive powers which so greatly affect the interests of the corporation when it comes into being are not entitled to disregard the interests of that corporation altogether they must make a reasonable use of the powers which they accept from the legislature with regard to the formation of the corporation and that requires them to pay some regard to its interests and consequently they do stand with regard to that corporation when formed in what is commonly called a fiduciary relation to some extent some reference was made in the argument to the companies act 1867 30  31 vict c 131 s 38  on the construction of which there has been a great diversity of judicial opinion that section does contain the word “promoters” which as i have already observed is not to be found in the companies act 1862 but it imposes no fresh duty on them with regard to the company it imposes a fresh duty towards and gives a new cause of action to persons who take shares in the company as individuals it does not affect the obligation of the promoters towards the corporation i think that the extent of that fiduciary relation which as already said in my opinion the promoters bear to the company is a very important consideration in construing that section and i am desirous to avoid prejudging that question by saying in this case more than is necessary for its decision i think as already said that the promoters are in a situation of confidence to some extent towards the company they form where as in the present case the company is formed for the purpose of becoming purchasers from the promoters as vendors the interests of the promoters and of the company clash it is the vendors interest to get as high a price as possible and they have a strong bias to overvalue the property which they are selling it is the purchasers interest to give as low a price as possible and to secure that the price actually given is not more than the property is really worth to them lord eldon in gibson v jeyes says that “it is a great rule of the court that he who bargains in matters of advantage with a person placing confidence in him is bound to shew that a reasonable use has been made of that confidence—a rule applying to trustees attorneys or any one else” i think persons having property to sell may form a company for the purpose of buying it in such a manner as to shew this and when they do so the sale will be unimpeachable i will not attempt to define how this may be done probably there are many ways what i shall do is to inquire what on the evidence appears to have been done in this case and then to confine myself to saying whether on the facts of this particular case it appears that an unreasonable use has been made of that confidence which the company did not indeed place in the promoters for the company did not then exist but which the legislature did place in them for the company when it gave the promoters power to create it  the burden of proof lies on the fiduciary agents agents selling to those to whom they owed a duty to prove if not that sufficient protection had been afforded at least that they had sufficient reasons for bonâ fide believing that sufficient protection had been afforded to their purchasers if they could have proved that sir thomas dakin was told that the price at which the property had been recently bought was £55000 and also that the knew that westall  by whom the prospectus was prepared from evidence which he had collected was not a disinterested attorney but one having a strong bias in favour of the vendors they should have done so if such proof had been given and it had been shewn that sir thomas dakin  well aware that for these reasons he should receive the statements and evidence of value with caution had satisfied himself that the bargain was a good one at £110000 the case would have been very different i doubt whether the opinion of one disinterested person so obtained would have been enough protection but that it is not necessary to consider if as i think it is not proved that even this slight degree of protection was given my lords i have felt much doubt and difficulty as to the second question though on the whole i think the plaintiffs have not lost their remedy several points were made and argued as to which i think it unnecessary to say more than that i think they were satisfactorily disposed of in the judgments below that on which i have difficulty and to which i shall confine my remarks is whether laches and acquiescence is made out to such an extent as to deprive the company of the remedy by rescission which they had if they had come promptly some things are to my mind clear the contract was not void but only voidable at the election of the company in clough v the london and north western railway company in the judgment of the exchequer chamber it is said “we agree that the contract continues valid till the party defrauded has determined his election by avoiding it in such cases ie of fraud the question is has the person on whom the fraud was practised having notice of the fraud elected not to avoid the contract or has he elected to avoid it or has he made no election we think that so long as he has made no election he retains the right to determine it either way subject to this that if in the interval whilst he is deliberating an innocent third party has acquired an interest in the property or if in consequence of his delay the position even of the wrongdoer is affected it will preclude him from exercising his right to rescind” it is i think clear on principles of general justice that as a condition to a rescission there must be a restitutio in integrum  the parties must be put in statu quo  see per lord cranworth in addie v the western bank it is a doctrine which has often been acted upon both at law and in equity but there is a considerable difference in the mode in which it is applied in courts of law and equity owing as i think to the difference of the machinery which the courts have at command i speak of these courts as they were at the time when this suit commenced without inquiring whether the judicature acts make any or if any what difference it would be obviously unjust that a person who has been in possession of property under the contract which he seeks to repudiate should be allowed to throw that back on the other partys hands without accounting for any benefit he may have derived from the use of the property or if the property though not destroyed has been in the interval deteriorated without making compensation for that deterioration but as a court of law has no machinery at its command for taking an account of such matters the defrauded party if he sought his remedy at law must in such cases keep the property and sue in an action for deceit in which the jury if properly directed can do complete justice by giving as damages a full indemnity for all that the party has lost see clarke v dixon and the cases there cited but a court of equity could not give damages and unless it can rescind the contract can give no relief and on the other hand it can take accounts of profits and make allowance for deterioration and i think the practice has always been for a court of equity to give this relief whenever by the exercise of its powers it can do what is practically just though it cannot restore the parties precisely to the state they were in before the contract and a court of equity requires that those who come to it to ask its active interposition to give them relief should use due diligence after there has been such notice or knowledge as to make it inequitable to lie by and any change which occurs in the position of the parties or the state of the property after such notice or knowledge should tell much more against the party in morâ  than a similar change before he was in morâ should do in lindsay petroleum company v hurd it is said “the doctrine of laches in courts of equity is not an arbitrary or a technical doctrine where it would be practically unjust to give a remedy either because the party has by his conduct done that which might fairly be regarded as equivalent to a waiver of it or where by his conduct and neglect he has though perhaps not waiving that remedy yet put the other party in a situation in which it would not be reasonable to place him if the remedy were afterwards to be asserted in either of these cases lapse of time and delay are most material but in every case if an argument against relief which otherwise would be just is founded upon mere delay that delay of course not amounting to a bar by any statute of limitations the validity of that defence must be tried upon principles substantially equitable two circumstances always important in such cases are the length of the delay and the nature of the acts done during the interval which might affect either party and cause a balance of justice or injustice in taking the one course or the other so far as relates to the remedy” i have looked in vain for any authority which gives a more distinct and definite rule than this and i think from the nature of the inquiry it must always be a question of more or less depending on the degree of diligence which might reasonably be required and the degree of change which has occurred whether the balance of justice or injustice is in favour of granting the remedy or withholding it the determination of such a question must largely depend on the turn of mind of those who have to decide and must therefore be subject to uncertainty but that i think is inherent in the nature of the inquiry the plaintiffs in this case are an incorporated company but i think that in considering the question of laches the court cannot divest itself of the knowledge that the corporation is an aggregate of individuals the knowledge of one shareholder is not the knowledge of the others but i think great injustice might sometimes be done if it were held that where it is shewn that all the shareholders who paid reasonable attention to the affairs of the company had notice sufficient to make it laches in them not to act promptly there could not be laches in the company unless the notice was brought home to the company in its corporate capacity but at the same time it should be recollected that shareholders who seek to set aside a contract made by the governing body have practically first to change that governing body and must have time to do so now in the present case every allottee had from the beginning by the prospectus full notice that the vendor john marsh evans  was also one of their directors which alone might have given them an equity to set aside the contract though in every other respect it was unimpeachable if that had been the only ground on which the shareholders were entitled to relief its seems clear that it would have been impossible to give it even the day after the directors took possession and paid the price they had however much more substantial equities but they had also notice of more for the prospectus referring to the contract which was open to inspection at the office i think each allottee was fixed with the knowledge which he would have had if he had read it that evans had purchased from chatteris so recently as the 30th of august not quite three weeks before he sold to the company he would have not known at what price it had been purchased but as that was known to all who had an interest in the company under liquidation either as creditors or contributors it could very easily have been ascertained and in fact it was known and stated at the meeting in february now though this was not actual knowledge that the other four directors had not made independent inquiry before making the purchase it was enough in my opinion to have put any reasonable shareholder upon inquiry and the circumstances attending the nature of the property which are mentioned by the lord chancellor in his opinion were such as to make it proper for those who intended to get rid of the bargain to act with considerable promptitude what weighs most with me is that it appears that if the price of phosphate had not fallen below £5 a ton there would have been a profit of £1 a ton and the bargain would not have been a bad one if it had risen the bargain would have been a good one and would no doubt have been approved but i see nothing to lead to the conclusion that the shareholders were waiting to see how the market turned out prices no doubt began to fall about february 1872 and continued to fall but not with a sudden fall if i thought the shareholders had been waiting to see how the market ruled it might have made a difference in my opinion if no steps to repudiate a purchase of a lottery ticket were taken till after the ticket came up a blank so that the purchaser if it came up a prize might have kept it it would surely be inequitable to set aside the contract then and though not nearly so strong a case such delay seems to be somewhat of that nature on the other hand i feel that there is much force in the observation that those who deal inequitably with a company know that it must necessarily be slow in its proceedings and are not entitled to complain that time elapses and that it is not desirable that such a rule should be laid down as would practically deprive a company when defrauded of relief and this is a reason against considering a company as precluded from that relief to which it would otherwise be entitled on account of delay unless the delay is excessive i can find no case in which even a private individual has been precluded by mere delay except where the delay has been very much greater than in this case in prendergrast v turton nine years elapsed in clegg v edmondson nearly as long and in both cases the plaintiff had lain by whilst the defendants were investing money in the mine until that investment proved to be remunerative it was clearly not equitable to leave the defendants to all the risk of loss and claim to themselves a profit and this seems to be what lord eldon principally relied on in norway v rowe in the present case that is no ground for imputing to the plaintiffs what lord lyndhurst in prendergrast v turton calls a “conditional acquiescence” as is pointed out in clarke v hart there was in prendergrast v turton very nearly if not quite a legal defence here taking the time at which the active shareholders were put upon exerting diligence to be february there was not quite nine months before the filing of the bill that is not very long for getting the majority of shareholders to make an inquiry turn out the board and get proper advice before instituting a chancery suit and having come to the conclusion before that the company had once had the right to this relief i think the burthen is on the defendants to shew that the company have precluded themselves from the relief to which they had a right i do not think this is made out lord penzance lord hatherley lord ohagan lord selborne and lord gordon concurred

east yi west xia yi xia dong xi shuo 夷夏東西說 is an obsolete theory about the origin of prehistory culture in current china which says that the culture of shang dynasty was established by two ethnic groups western part of shang dynasty was developed by xia ethnic group and the eastern part of shang dynasty was developed by yi ethnic group this theory was suggested by fu sinian in 1933 it was further expanded by liang siyong who suggested that the newly discovered yangshao culture was established by the xia in the west and the  longshan culture by the yi peoples of the east for chinese and western historians this hypothesis became the prevailing theory to interpret chinese prehistory and remained so until about 1960 further archaeological discoveries made the theory obsolete in 1950s it became clear that the yinxu culture was preceded by the erligang culture in zhongyuan in addition the gap between the erligang culture and the longshan culture was joined by the erlitou culture which was named after the erlitou site discovered in 1959 chinese scholars identify the erligang and erlitou cultures as the sites of the shang and xia dynaties respectively although the archaeological boundary between the two dynasties was still debatable in 1983 the ruin of yanshi shang city was discovered and identified as the erligang culture the ruin very close to the erlitou site suggests that the erlitou and erligang cultures were dominated by people with different cultural background in shandong the shandong longshan culture was replaced by the yueshi culture around 2000 bc the sites of the yueshi culture show complementary distribution with those of the erligang culture which expanded eastward from zhongyuan it proved that the shang people did not originated in the east though largely modified by further research fu sinians theory entered the history as a landmark in chinese historiography it essentially questioned ethnic homogeneity sometimes postulated as the route of chinese civilization this contributed to the concept of the dialogical development of cultures see for an english language summary of this theory

in numerical mathematics interval propagation or interval constraint propagation is the problem of contracting interval domains associated to variables of r without removing any value that is consistent with a set of constraints ie equations or inequalities  it is can be used to propagate uncertainties in the situation where errors are represented by intervals
  interval propagation considers an estimation problem as a constraint satisfaction problem a contractor associated to an equation involving the variables x1xn is an operator which contracts the intervals x1 xn that are supposed to enclose the xis without removing any value for the variables that is consistent with the equation a contractor is said to be atomic if it is not built as a composition of other contractors the main theory that is used to build atomic contractors are based on interval analysis example consider for instance the equation which involves the three variables x1x2 and x3 the associated contractor is given by the following statements for instance if the contractor performs the following calculus for other constraints a specific algorithm for implementing the atomic contractor should be written an illustration is the atomic contractor associated to the equation is provided by figures 1 and 2 for more complex constraints a decomposition into atomic constraints ie constraints for which an atomic contractor exists should be performed consider for instance the constraint could be decomposed into the interval domains that should be associated to the new intermediate variables are the principle of the interval propagation is to call all available atomic contractors until no more contraction could be observed as a result of the knastertarski theorem the procedure always converges to intervals which enclose all feasible values for the variables  a formalization of the interval propagation can be made thanks to the contractor algebra  interval propagation converges quickly to the result and can deal with problems involving several hundred of variables
 consider the electronic circuit of figure 3 from the circuit we have the following equations after performing the interval propagation we get

belair park is located in west dulwich part of the london borough of southwark southeast london england  formerly the grounds belonged to belair house a country villa built in adam style and now a grade ii listed building there are two other grade ii listed structures within the park the lodge and entrance gate  and an old stable building 1726–1781
the original estate consisted of two farms 1785–1818
the estate was leased to john willes corn factor of whitechapel who erected a house in the style of or possibly by robert adam this house was named college place the lake was mentioned by willes when he first leased the land from dulwich college which would indicate that the original boundary of the estate was beyond that point 1818–1859
after john willes death there was a new owner charles ranken a solicitor who renamed the house belair 1859–1893
charles hutton a wool merchant and sheriff for london and middlesex purchased the remainder of the lease it would seem that the majority of structural changes occurred during his ownership north and south wings together with conservatories and numerous outbuildings were constructed and added on eventually belair had 47 rooms which is very much bigger than it is today he lived there with his wife their eleven children and ten livein servants however the house fell into disrepair when huttons berlin wool business started to lose money 1893–1938
sir evan spicer of spicers the paper merchants was granted a lease in his time the house still had a farm with cows pigs chickens ducks and horses including a grey carthorse called dobbin in the coach house by the gallery road entrance there was a coach and horses to take sir evan and his family across dulwich park to emmanuel church in barry road on sundays there is still the original pump outside the coach house which was used to water the horses sir evan spicer was the last private owner of the belair estate 1938–1946
belair was sold by auction after spicers death with the onset of world war ii it again fell into a state of ruin it was used first as a store then as premises for the military 1946–1980
southwark council purchased the lease as the main building was in such a poor state it had to be rebuilt from ground level retaining only the original staircase these renovations completed in 1964 restored the house as willes had built it without the extra wings and conservatories 1980–1995
still under council ownership belair served a similar purpose to that of a village hall many people remember the times when they would use the facilities for ballet lessons or as changing roomscitation needed the only maintenance during this time was the painting of the exterior 1996–2002
gary cady took over the running of belair house and oversaw a complete refurbishment of the entire building turning it into a restaurant and bar 2002–2004
sam hajaj took over belair house for two years until november 2002 no major work was carried out in this period 2004 to 2013

command authority andor the force commander the fleet marine force may conduct special operations under circumstances where designated special operations forces are not available in february 2006 the marine corps made its first commitment to the ussocom community in cause of the establishment of the marine special operations command or marsoc  this new commitment allowed marsoc to form the marine special operation teams msot assigned under the marine special operation battalions or msobs  the msots are the marine corpss first sof unit to be trained and reserved for missions specifically regarding unconventional methods which consequently disbanded the fmfs force reconnaissance companies to make way for the msots fully committed direct action capabilities  many force reconnaissance

historians can trace the evolution of the corps’s specialized amphibious warfare since its formation traditionally being tasked in conducting specialized missions conformed to maritime environments  the us marines and sailors are already equipped and wellprepared because of their expeditionary capabilities that are wellknown to the community there have been controversial effects of incorporating the meu socs capabilities  the marine corps periodically had to struggle with the department of the navy or department of defense in formulating a special operations force within the combined functions of the fmf  in fact the fmf formulated several softype units in the past the marine raiders dissolved moments before the end of world war ii terminating their direct actionstylized institution  it was felt throughout the marine corps that the raiders were acting in complex of being an elite within the elite nonetheless the raider battalions were deactivated  momentarily the paramarines also shared the same fate ever since world war ii new threats that have been emerging became the main focus terrorism warring factions and environmental catastrophes while the worldwide population increases  marines must now cope with the expected changes of the way warfare is being fought in the 21st century  its reason is that the marine corps has epitomized its sole function in modern amphibious and expeditionary warfare  no other armed naval services throughout history has reasoned feasibly in sustaining a rapid offensive landing force onto hostile shores yet remaining codependent on conventional strategies  in order for the corps to send marines to accommodate new perils recommendations were made to standardize and relate all their training for modern warfare  the fleet marine force revised its title x charter by incorporating their already ‘amphibious and expeditionary capability’ into unique missions including a special operations mission if the need arises a significant shift in thinking was dramatized by the foresight of thendeputy secretary of defense william h taft stated in 1983 despite efforts the perception of competition between the sofs and the specialized marine units has persisted and caused friction in ussocom in the past the marine corps focused more on yesterdays high intensity conventional open sea airland battlefields such as those expected during the cold war  nowadays it has been replaced by the more probable mid and low intensity conflicts  missions that would require armed conflicts or humanitariandisaster relief were conceived and many tacticians feared that the marine corps were trying to emulate the larger landbased united states army with counterparts from the united states navy marines have the ability to be projected to any hostile area around the globe due to their maneuverability from the sea  this gives the marine corps the advantage over the other military branches marines can be deployed to a hostile situation large or small within short notice from the commanderinchief ever since the advanced base force was conceived the enhanced and inherent capabilities of the fleet marine force has proven the marine corps operational flexibility as a unique elite maritime force  the marine corps is far more capable of making the adjustments to the changing threat than any other service  marine

the 1926 general strike in the united kingdom was a general strike that lasted 10 days from 3 may 1926 to 13 may 1926 it was called by the general council of the trades union congress tuc in an unsuccessful attempt to force the british government to act to prevent wage reduction and worsening conditions for 800000 lockedout coal miners  some 17 million workers went out especially in transport and heavy industry the government was prepared and enlisted middle class volunteers to maintain essential services  there was little violence and the tuc gave up in defeat in the long run there was little impact on tradeunion activity or industrial relations mine owners therefore announced that their intention was to reduce miners wages  the mfgb rejected the terms not a penny off the pay not a minute on the day  the tuc responded to this news by promising to support the miners in their dispute the conservative government under stanley baldwin decided to intervene declaring that they would provide a ninemonth subsidy to maintain the miners wages and that a royal commission under the chairmanship of sir herbert samuel would look into the problems of the mining industry this decision became known as red friday because it was seen as a victory for workingclass solidarity and socialism in practice the subsidy gave the mine owners and the government time to prepare for a major labour dispute herbert smith a leader of the miners federation of great britain said of this event we have no need to glorify about victory it is only an armistice the samuel commission published a report on 10 march 1926 recommending that in the future national agreements the nationalisation of royalties and sweeping reorganisation and improvement should be considered for the mining industry it also recommended a reduction by 135 of miners wages along with the withdrawal of the government subsidy  two weeks later the prime minister announced that the government would accept the report provided other parties also did  a previous royal commission the sankey commission had recommended nationalisation a few years earlier to deal with the problems of productivity and profitability in the industry but lloyd george then prime minister had rejected its report after the samuel commissions report the mine owners declared that on penalty of lock out from 1 may miners would have to accept new terms of employment that included lengthening the work day and reducing wages between 10 and 25 depending on various factors the miners federation of great britain mfgb refused the wage reduction and regional negotiation final negotiations began on 1 may when an agreement was almost reached however one million miners were locked out it being impossible to get them back to work without firm assurances concerning their wages lastminute negotiations failed to achieve this leading to announcement by the tuc that a general strike in defence of miners wages and hours was to begin on 3 may a monday at one minute to midnight the leaders of the labour party were terrified by the revolutionary elements within the union movement or at least worried about the damage association with them would do to their newly established reputation as a more moderate party of government and were unhappy about the proposed general strike during the next two days frantic efforts were made to reach an agreement with the government and the mine owners however these efforts failed mainly owing to an eleventhhour decision by printers of the daily mail to refuse to print an editorial for king and country condemning the general strike they objected to the following passage a general strike is not an industrial dispute it is a revolutionary move which can only succeed by destroying the government and subverting the rights and liberties of the people when baldwin heard of this he called off the negotiations with the tuc saying that the printers action was interfering with the liberty of the press king george v took exception to suggestions that the strikers were revolutionaries saying try living on their wages before you judge them the tuc feared that an allout general strike would bring revolutionary elements to the fore and limited the participants to railwaymen transport workers printers dockers ironworkers and steelworkers as these were regarded as pivotal in the dispute the government had prepared for the strike over the nine months in which it had provided a subsidy creating organisations such as the organisation for the maintenance of supplies and did whatever it could to keep the country moving it rallied support by emphasizing the revolutionary nature of the strikers the armed forces and volunteer workers helped maintain basic services the governments emergency powers act—an act to maintain essential supplies—had been passed in 1920 on 4 may 1926 the number of strikers was about 15–175 million there were strikers from john o groats to lands end workers reaction to the strike call was immediate and overwhelming and surprised both the government and the tuc the latter not being in control of the strike on this first day there were no major initiatives and no dramatic events except for the nations transport being at a standstill “constitutional government is being attacked let all good citizens whose livelihood and labour have thus been put in peril bear with fortitude and patience the hardships with which they have been so suddenly confronted stand behind the government who are doing their part confident that you will cooperate in the measures they have undertaken to preserve the liberties and privileges of the people of these islands the laws of england are the people’s birthright the laws are in your keeping you have made parliament their guardian the general strike is a challenge to parliament and is the road to anarchy and ruin” on 5 may 1926 both sides gave their views churchill at that time chancellor of the exchequer commented as editor of the government newspaper british gazette  i do not agree that the tuc have as much right as the government to publish their side of the case and to exhort their followers to continue action it is a very much more difficult task to feed the nation than it is to wreck it baldwin wrote that the general strike is a challenge to the parliament and is the road to anarchy in the british worker the tucs newspaper we are not making war on the people we are anxious that the ordinary members of the public shall not be penalized for the unpatriotic conduct of the mine owners and the government in the meantime the government put in place a militia of special constables called the organisation for the maintenance of supplies oms they were volunteers to maintain order in the street a special constable said it was not difficult to understand the strikers attitude toward us after a few days i found my sympathy with them rather than with the employers for one thing i had never realized the appalling poverty which existed if i had been aware of all the facts i should not have joined up as a special constable it was decided that fascists would not be allowed to enlist in the oms without first giving up their political beliefs as the government feared a rightwing backlash so the fascists formed q division under rotha lintornorman to combat the strikers on 6 may 1926 there was a change of atmosphere the government newspaper british gazette suggested that means of transport began to improve with volunteers and blackleg workers stating on the front page that there were 200 buses on the streets  these were however figures of propaganda as there were in fact only 86 buses running on 7 may 1926 the tuc met with sir herbert samuel and worked out a set of proposals designed to end the dispute the miners federation rejected the proposals the british worker was increasingly difficult to operate because churchill had requisitioned the bulk of the supply of the papers newsprint so reduced its size from eight pages to four in the meantime the government took action to protect the men who decided to return to work on 8 may 1926 there was a dramatic moment on the london docks lorries were protected by the army they broke the picket line and transported food to hyde park this episode showed that the government was in greater control of the situation it was also a measure of baldwins rationalism in place of churchills more reactionary stance churchill had wanted in a move that would have proved unnecessarily antagonistic to the strikers to arm the soldiers baldwin however had insisted they not be armed on 11 may 1926 the flying scotsman was derailed by strikers near newcastle the british worker alarmed at the fears of the general council of the tuc that there was to be a mass drift back to work claimed the number of strikers has not diminished it is increasing there are more workers out today than there have been at any moment since the strike began however the national sailors and firemens union applied for an injunction in the chancery division of the high court to enjoin the generalsecretary of its tower hill branch from calling its members out on strike mr justice astbury granted the injunction ruling that no trade dispute could exist between the tuc and the government of the nation and that save for strike in the coal industry the general strike was not protected by trade disputes act 1906 in addition he ruled that the strike in the plaintiff union had been called in contravention of its own rules as a result the unions involved became liable at common law for incitement to breach of contract and faced potential sequestration of their assets by employers on 12 may 1926 the tuc general council visited 10 downing street to announce their decision to call off the strike provided that the proposals worked out by the samuel commission were adhered to and that the government offered a guarantee that there would be no victimization of strikers the government stated that it had no power to compel employers to take back every man who had been on strike thus the tuc agreed to end the dispute without such an agreement the miners maintained resistance for a few months before being forced by their own economic needs to return to the mines by the end of november most miners were back at work however many remained unemployed for many years those that were employed were forced to accept longer hours lower wages and district wage agreements the strikers felt as though they had achieved nothing the effect on the british coalmining industry was profound by the late 1930s employment in mining had fallen by more than onethird from its prestrike peak of 12 million miners but productivity had rebounded from under 200 tons produced per miner to over 300 tons by the outbreak of the second world war the trade disputes and trade unions act of 1927 among other things forbade sympathetic strikes and mass picketing it was the only general strike in british history for union leaders such as ernest bevin—who had coordinated the strike—considered it a mistake they decided that action through political parties was a better solution

services other than the free articles the fulltexts are accessed by subscription acms primary historical competitor has been the ieee computer society which is the largest subgroup of the institute of electrical and electronics engineers the ieee focuses more on hardware and standardization issues than theoretical computer science but there is considerable overlap with acms agenda they occasionally cooperate on projects like developing computing curricula some of the major awards in computer science are given jointly by acm and the ieee–cs there is also a mounting challenge to the acms publication practices coming from the open access movement some authors see a centralized peer–review process as less relevant and publish on their home pages or on unreviewed sites like arxiv other organizations have sprung up which do their peer review entirely free and online such as journal of artificial intelligence research jair journal of machine learning research jmlr and the journal of research and practice in information technology in addition to student and regular members acm has several advanced membership grades to recognize those with multiple years of membership and demonstrated performance that sets them apart from their peers the acm fellows program was established by council of the association for computing machinery in 1993 to recognize and honor outstanding acm members for their achievements in computer science and information technology and for their significant contributions to the mission of the acm there are presently about 500 fellows out of about

in tokyo sang majulah singapura at the 2006 fifa world cup asian qualifying rounds at saitama stadium in saitama japan two months later in january 2005 singapore idol taufik batisah was invited to become the first performer to sing majulah singapura at an international football game at the national stadium in singapore – the return leg of the tiger cup now the aff football championship final between singapore and indonesia in singapore due to national service commitments taufik had to decline and was replaced by singer jai wahab in july 2005 singaporean singer and actress jacintha abisheganaden sang the national anthem at the esplanade – theatres on the bay during the opening ceremony of the 117th session of the international olympic committee at which london was selected to

133 not singing the anthem according to the official lyrics or singing a translation of the lyrics the penalty is a fine not exceeding s1000 in addition guidelines issued by the ministry of information communications and the arts mica state that either instrumental or vocal versions of the national anthem may be performed and that dignity and decorum should be observed whenever the anthem is played or sung interviewed by the oral history department in 1989 dr toh chin chye said it was appropriate for the national anthem to be in malay the indigenous language of the region as english is not native to this part of the world he felt that the malay version of the national anthem would appeal to all races it can be easily understood and at the same time it can be easily remembered it must be brief to the point  and can be sung however on 22 july 1991 the english daily newspaper the straits times reported that during a meeting between the then prime minister goh chok tong and community leaders a group of grassroots leaders and a lawyer had suggested that adjustments be made to the national anthem the given reason was that many singaporeans could not sing it in malay and therefore did not have strong feelings or strong emotions when they sing the national anthem in particular some grassroots leaders argued that since the chinese constitute a majority of the population a mandarin version of the anthem should be used the prime ministers response was that he would keep the national anthem as it was while ensuring that translations in other mother tongues were more easily available the proposal to change the lyrics was also criticized by former deputy prime minister s rajaratnam who felt that the malay lyrics of the anthem were so simple that anyone over the age of five unless mentally retarded had no difficulty singing the anthem all singaporean children of kindergarten age have not only had no difficulty memorising the words but have for decades sung it every morning with strong feelings and emotion he also noted that the anthem had been translated into singapores three other official languages english mandarin and tamil for those who cannot understand malay a subsequent poll by the straits times found that while many singaporeans knew what the anthem generally meant only seven out of 35 persons interviewed knew the meaning of each word however all but three of those interviewed agreed that the anthem should continue to be sung in malay the three persons who disagreed felt that the anthem should be in english because that was the language most commonly used in singapore all the interviewees including those who did not know the meaning of the lyrics said they felt a sense of pride when they heard or sang the national anthem singer taufik batisah was criticized for incorrectly singing the word berseru to proclaim instead of bersatu to unite during his rendition of majulah singapura before the start of the 2009 formula 1 singtel singapore grand prix on 27 september 2009 a straits times poll then found that out of 50 people only 10 were able to sing the national anthem perfectly most people got between 80 and 90 of the lyrics right while six could only recite the first line or less although many correctly stated that the title of the anthem meant onward singapore a majority did not understand the meaning of the anthem however most of the persons surveyed disagreed that the anthem should be in english one respondent saying its better in malay because theres a cultural history to it and it is more meaningful and has traces to our roots an abridged version of majulah singapura had been used by official bodies since 1965 although an expanded version used only at grand ceremonial functions exists these versions were arranged by an englishman michael hurd this arrangement was first recorded by the singapore symphony orchestra under the baton of lim yau in 1989 the original version of the national anthem was in the key of g major although in 1983 schools were issued an educational tape describing common mistakes made in singing the anthem and given the option of singing the anthem in f major in 1993 the shorter version of majulah singapura was declared to be the official one on 19 january 2001 majulah singapura was officially relaunched in the fmajor key as this was said to be a grander and more inspiring arrangement of the anthem the ministry of information and the arts mita now the ministry of communications and information mci took more than a year to produce the new version its main objective was to make the anthem more accessible to all singaporeans in may 2000 several leading local composers were invited to rearrange the national anthem in f major an evaluation panel headed by bernard tan selected the version submitted by cultural medallion winner phoon yew tien phoons orchestration employed a slower tempo and used more instruments to create a majestic rendition of the anthem mita then commissioned ken lim to produce a recording by the singapore symphony orchestra conducted by lim yau which was carried out at the victoria concert hall on 20 november 2000 the new arrangement was recorded in seven versions including two orchestral versions instrumental and with soloist jacintha abisheganaden and the singapore youth choir and a piano solo version mari kita

maternal use of androgens or high doses of certain weakly androgenic synthetic progestogens progestins structurally related to testosterone can masculinize virilize the external genitalia of a female fetus during susceptible times in pregnancy some degree of fusion of the labioscrotal folds and urogenital folds and clitoral enlargement can occur if exposure occurs from the 8th through the 12th week of gestation but only clitoral enlargement can occur if exposure occurs after the 12th week
this can in some cases result in ambiguous genitalia fetal masculinization of female external genitalia is usually due to enzyme abnormalities involved in adrenal steroid biosynthesis resulting in congenital adrenal hyperplasia cah fetal masculinization of female external genitalia is much less frequently due to maternal use of androgenic steroids fetal masculinization of female external genitalia due to maternal use of androgenic steroids is generally less advanced than that due to cah and unlike cah does not cause progressive virilization affected females mature normally with normal fertility there is almost total regression of the genital anomaly in cases of simple clitoral enlargement and in even the most severe cases surgical correction of labioscrotal fusion is relatively simple the incidence of fetal masculinization of female external genitalia varies with the drug and dosage the only sex steroid currently utilized in women that can cause virilization of female fetuses when administered in usually administered doses is the androgen danazol a derivative of ethisterone 17αethinyltestosterone fetal masculinization of female external genitalia has resulted from doses of danazol as low as 200 mgday whereas 800 mgday is the usual initial dose when danazol is used to treat severe endometriosis in general pregnane derivatives progesterone dydrogesterone 17αhydroxyprogesterone caproate medroxyprogesterone acetate megestrol acetate etc do not virilize even in high dose testosterone derivatives ethisterone and 19nortestosterone norethisterone norethisterone acetate etc generally virilize but there are exceptions eg norethynodrel that do not the only progestogens currently used during pregnancy for luteal support in ivf protocols or for prevention of preterm birth in pregnant women with a history of at least one spontaneous preterm birth are  progesterone 17αhydroxyprogesterone caproate and dydrogesterone doses of 19nortestosterones required for virilization are 1020 mgday far in excess of that associated with inadvertent contraceptive exposure during pregnancy
genital ambiguity due to progestogen exposure is thus mostly a topic of historical concern the first drugs reported to cause fetal masculinization were the androgens methandriol and methyltestosterone in the mid 1950s on june 21 1976 the fda approved the androgen danazol danocrine a derivative of ethisterone 17αethinyltestosterone for treatment of endometriosis with a warning that its use in pregnancy is contraindicated because of the risk of masculinization of external genitalia of female fetuses the first case report of fetal masculinization of the external genitalia of a female infant born to a mother inadvertently treated in pregnancy with danazol was published in 1981 between 1975 and 1990 danocrines manufacturer winthrop laboratories received reports worldwide of 129 pregnant women exposed to danazol with 94 completed pregnancies and the birth of 57 female infants — 23 40 of whom were virilized with a pattern of clitoromegaly fused labia and urogenital sinus formation with genital reconstructive surgery usually but not always required in childhood
it is likely that the true rate of occurrence is much less than 40 as many cases with a normal outcome would not be reported no genital anomalies were reported where danazol therapy was discontinued before the 8th week of pregnancy the warnings against use of danazol were progressively strengthened in the 1980s in 1991 the fda required a black box warning that use of danazol in pregnancy is contraindicated because exposure to danazol in utero may result in androgenic effects on the female fetus causing external genitalia masculinization the black box warning recommends a sensitive hcgbetasubunit pregnancy test immediately prior to starting danazol therapy and use of a nonhormonal method of contraception during therapy as of 2000 there had been published reports of fetal masculinization of female external genitalia in in the 1940s some studies suggested that progesterone could prevent threatened abortion and might prevent habitual abortion but oral bioavailability of progesterone is low and injections of progesterone can be painful so orally active progestins were tried beginning with ethisterone followed by other progestins as they became available northynodrel enovid and norethisterone norlutin in 1957 medroxyprogesterone acetate provera in 1959 norethisterone acetate norlutate in 1961 and dydrogesterone duphaston in 1962 the first case reports of fetal masculinization of external genitalia of female infants born to mothers treated in pregnancy with highdose ethisterone 17αethinyltestosterone and highdose norethisterone 17αethinyl19nortestosterone to prevent miscarriage were published in 1957 and 1958 respectively in a march 1960 jama article pediatric endocrinologist lawson wilkins at johns hopkins reported on 34 cases of fetal masculinization of external genitalia of female infants born from 1950 to 1959 to mothers treated with highdose 20250 mgday ethisterone to prevent miscarriage and 35 cases of fetal masculinization of external genitalia of female infants born from 1957 to 1959 to mothers treated with highdose 1040 mgday norethisterone to prevent miscarriage in 1961 ciba and parkedavis added the reported association of ethisterone and norethisterone with masculinization of external genitalia of the female fetus to the precautions section of their advertisements to physicians and physician prescribing information a clinical trial published in the october 1962 american journal of obstetrics and gynecology reported fetal masculinization of external genitalia of 14 of 59 female infants 24 born to mothers who began highdose 1040 mgday norethisterone treatment to prevent miscarriage in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy 11 infants had slight clitoral enlargement 1 had marked clitoral enlargement 2 infants had marked clitoral enlargement and partial fusion of the labioscrotal folds fetal masculinization of external genitalia of 1 of 23 female infants born to mothers who began highdose 1040 mgday norethisterone treatment to prevent miscarriage after the 12th week of pregnancy 1 infant with slight clitoral enlargement was born to a mother who began norethisterone treatment in week 13 in 1964 parkedavis revised the physician prescribing information for norlutin norethisterone and norlutate norethisterone acetate to remove their indications for use in infertility habitual abortion and threatened abortion and add pregnancy as a contraindication to their use because of the possibility of masculinization of external genitalia of the female fetus in 1977 the fda determined that there was no adequate evidence that progestogens including progesterone dydrogesterone and 17αhydroxyprogesterone caproate were effective in treating threatened abortion or preventing habitual abortion and withdrew approval for those indications as of 2000 there had been published reports of fetal masculinization of female external genitalia in on july 22 1977 the fda published a notice requiring a black box warning on all progestogen drugs except contraceptives to warn against their use during the first four months of pregnancy because of reports of nongenital birth defects on january 12 1989 after determining that progestogens did not cause nongenital birth defects the fda published a notice revising the black box warning on all progestogen drugs except contraceptives to warn against their use during the first four months of pregnancy because of past reports of genital birth defects an increased risk of hypospadias in male fetuses and mild virilization of the external genitalia in female fetuses on november 16 1999 the fda published a notice effective november 16 2000 removing after 22 years the black box warning on all progestogen drugs because it was unwarranted based on scientific review of current data m ♀ frs anatphysdevp nococongnpls sysiepon procasst drug g1g2bg3cd

an inguinal hernia ˈɪŋɡwɨnəl ˈhɜrniə is a protrusion of abdominalcavity contents through the inguinal canal they are very common in men lifetime risk 27 for men 3 for women though their repair is one of the most frequently performed surgical operations elective surgery is no longer recommended in minimally symptomatic cases due to the low risk of incarceration 02 per year and the significant risk 10–12 of post herniorraphy pain syndrome there are two types of inguinal hernia direct and indirect which are defined by their relationship to the inferior epigastric vessels direct inguinal hernias occur medial to the inferior epigastric vessels when abdominal contents herniate through a weak spot in the fascia of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal which is formed by the transversalis fascia indirect inguinal hernias occur when abdominal contents protrude through the deep inguinal ring lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels this may be caused by failure of embryonic closure of the processus vaginalis in the case of the female the opening of the superficial inguinal ring is smaller than that of the male as a result the possibility for hernias through the inguinal canal in males is much greater because they have a larger opening and therefore a much weaker wall through which the intestines may protrude inguinal hernias in turn belong to groin hernias which also includes femoral hernias a femoral hernia is not via the inguinal canal but via the femoral canal which normally allows passage of the common femoral artery and vein from the pelvis to the leg in amyands hernia the content of the hernial sac is the vermiform appendix in littres hernia the content of the hernial sac contains a meckels diverticulum clinical classification of hernia is also important according to which hernia is classified into reducible hernia is one which can be pushed back into the abdomen by putting manual pressure to it irreducible hernia is one which cannot be pushed back into the abdomen by applying manual pressure irreducible hernias are further classified into obstructed herniais one in which the lumen of the herniated part of intestine is obstructed but the blood supply to the hernial sac is intact incarcerated herniais one in which adhesions develop between the wall of hernial sac and the wall of intestine strangulated hernia is one in which the blood supply of the sac is cut off thus leading to ischemia the lumen of the intestine may be patentdisambiguation needed or not hernias present as bulges in the groin area that can become more prominent when coughing straining or standing up they are rarely painful and the bulge commonly disappears on lying down the inability to reduce or place the bulge back into the abdomen usually means the hernia is incarcerated which requires emergency surgery significant pain is suggestive of strangulated bowel an incarcerated indirect inguinal hernia as the hernia progresses contents of the abdominal cavity such as the intestines can descend into the hernia and run the risk of being pinched within the hernia causing an intestinal obstruction if the blood supply of the portion of the intestine caught in the hernia is compromised the hernia is deemed strangulated and gut ischemia and gangrene can result with potentially fatal consequences the timing of complications is not predictable emergency surgery for incarceration and strangulation carry much higher risk than planned elective procedures however the risk of incarceration is low evaluated at 02 per year on the other hand surgical intervention has a significant risk of causing inguinodynia and this is why minimally symptomatic patients are advised to watchful waiting differential diagnosis of the symptoms of inguinal hernia mainly includes the following potential conditions in men indirect hernias follow the same route as the descending testes which migrate from the abdomen into the scrotum during the development of the urinary and reproductive organs the larger size of their inguinal canal which transmitted the testicle and accommodates the structures of the spermatic cord might be one reason why men are 25 times more likely to have an inguinal hernia than women although several mechanisms such as strength of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal and shutter mechanisms compensating for raised intraabdominal pressure prevent hernia formation in normal individuals the exact importance of each factor is still under debate the physiological school of thought thinks that the risk of hernia is due to a physiological difference between patients who suffer hernia and those who do not namely the presence of aponeurotic extensions from the transversus abdominis aponeurotic arch there is currently no medical recommendation about how to manage an inguinal hernia condition due to the fact that until recently elective surgery used to be recommended the hernia truss is intended to contain a reducible inguinal hernia within the abdomen it is not considered to provide a cure and if the pads are hard and intrude into the hernia aperture they may cause scarring and enlargement of the aperture in addition most trusses with older designs are not able effectively to contain the hernia at all times because their pads do not remain permanently in contact with the hernia the more modern variety of truss is made with nonintrusive flat pads and comes with a guarantee to hold the hernia securely during all activities although there is as yet no proof that such devices can prevent an inguinal hernia from progressing they have been described by users as providing greater confidence and comfort when carrying out physically demanding taskscitation needed a truss also increases the probability of complicationswhich include strangulation of the hernia atrophy of the spermatic cord and atrophy of the fascial marginsthis allows the defect to enlarge and makes subsequent repair more difficult their popularity is likely to increase as many individuals with small painless hernias are now delaying hernia surgery due to the risk of postherniorrhaphy pain syndrome the elasticised pants used by athletes also provide useful support for the smaller hernia surgical correction of inguinal hernias is called a hernia repair it is currently not recommended in minimally symptomatic hernias for which watchful waiting is advised due to the risk of post herniorraphy pain syndrome surgery is commonly performed as outpatient surgery there are various surgical strategies which may be considered in the planning of inguinal hernia repair these include the consideration of mesh use eg synthetic or biologic open repair use of laparoscopy type of anesthesia general or local appropriateness of bilateral repair etc during surgery conducted under local anaesthesia the patient will be asked to cough and strain during the procedure to help in demonstrating that the repair is without tension and sound

edward john craigie 5 september 1871  17 january 1966 was a single tax league member for the south australian house of assembly seat of flinders from 1930 to 1941 born and raised in moonta south australia the son of scottish parents craigie left school aged 11 initially working as an office boy before stints as a baker and butcher in adelaide  from an early age craigie believed there needed to be a drastic overhaul of society to benefit the less privileged  initially attracted to socialism craigie was converted to the ideas of henry george who argued that all taxes should be abolished except for a single tax on unimproved land values craigie referred to it as a tax on the rental value of land brought into existence by the collective presence of the people returning to moonta in 1904 craigie joined the united labor party the predecessor of the australian labor party with the aim of incorporating single tax theory as party policy and worked as a political journalist for local papers  craigie was elected to moonta council in 1905 and successfully introduced a single tax system throughout the council area believing this to be the first step towards the nationwide institution of a tax on unimproved land values  considering his work done in moonta craigie resigned from the council and the labor party in 1911 to serve as secretary of the henry george league of south australia and form the single tax league in order to contest elections and gain support for single tax theory over the next two decades craigie unsuccessfully contested federal including the 1914 adelaide byelection state and adelaide city council elections on the platform of single tax either as a single tax league commonwealth liberal party or liberal union candidate but still found time to marry write a raft of treatises on tax reform and from 1921 serve as editor of the leagues newspaper the peoples advocate craigie finally found electoral success in 1930 in the south australian house of assembly electoral district of flinders which covered the west coast of south australia the stronghold of single tax theory in australia  the onset of the great depression had led to widespread public belief that the tax system had become too burdensome and complex and many sought a simpler solution for which the single tax theory spruiked by craigie seemed the answer described as a small mild and rather insignificant man craigie spent his time in parliament advocating to the exclusion of all other issues single tax theory was considered by many to be a colossal bore and his speeches usually long were generally very dull  craigie also had to deal with the enmity of labor supporters who considered him a rat for leaving the alp  they showed their displeasure by hurling fruit and attacking him during public meetings nevertheless craigie was reelected to flinders in 1933 and 1938 the latter as one of 15 independents in a house of 39 members  fellow independent tom stott attempted to form an independent led government with himself as premier but craigie refused to support anyone who did not wish to see single tax theory instituted by the 1941 election the electorate had tired of craigie and his ideas  he had however been elected president of the international union of single taxers in 1939 and continued in this role as well as league secretary until his retirement in 1948 thereafter remaining trustee of the henry george foundation australia a savvy investor craigie died in adelaide a wealthy man but with his lifes dream unfulfilled  as one commentator noted after his death he would have been an influential contributor to william ewart gladstones last ministry he was out of time and place in south australia
a graded stakes race is any thoroughbred horse race in the united states or canada that derives its name from the stake or entry fee owners must pay  the term has been applied since 1973 by the american graded stakes committee of the thoroughbred owners and breeders association  these fees to which the track adds an additional amount constitute the total amount from which prize money is paid to the first second third and usually fourth place finishers there are three different levels of stakes races the top ranking and therefore purse being a grade i stakes they are higherclass races for bigger prizes and often involve competitors that belong to the same gender age and class these races may though be weightforage with weights adjusted only according to age and also there are set weights where all horses carry the same weight furthermore there are conditions races in which horses carry weights that are set by conditions such as having won a certain number of races or races of a certain value finally some graded stakes are handicaps in which an official handicapper assigns weights to each horse in an attempt to equalize the competition the american graded stakes committee uses as some of its criteria for the grading in the united states and canada a graded race can be dormant for one year without losing its grade as long as the race meets these requirements the committee grades on the overall quality of the previous fields and the performance of horses in the previous fields in stakes both prior to and after the race for example if the winner of the breeders cup classic raced in the santa anita handicap then the race would almost certainly be a grade one graded stakes races are referred as group races in horseracing in europe

hallel of pesukei dezimra a selection of six psalms recited as part of pesukei dezimra hymnal verses — the introduction the daily morning service this  hallel is specifically ashrei most of which is psalm 145 followed by psalms 146150 the term hallel without a qualifier general refers to psalms 113118 which are recited only of festivals for this reason the hallel of pesukei dezimra is also known as the  daily hallel these psalms are recited because they are devoted entirely to the praise of god originally this was the only part of pesukei dezimra its recitation was considered voluntary for a long time there are contradictory views on the daily recitation of hallel the gemara refers to one who recites hallel daily as a blasphemer talmud bavli refers to one who recites it daily as praiseworthy the recitation of these six psalms as an alternative to 113118 is a compromise on this matter

and tails as when the series became iffy and listed them and all other characters in the series sans sonic and robotnik as being 2nd most in need to die on his top 10 list similarly he was listed as

jane thomas was the wife of a colonel in south carolina who fought for the rebels in the american revolution  she passed key intelligence that thwarted an ambush she was a native of chester county pennsylvania and the sister of the reverend john black of carlisle the first president of dickinson college she was married about 1740 to john thomas supposed to be a native of wales who had been brought up in the same county  some ten or fifteen years after his marriage mr thomas removed to south carolina his residence for some time was upon fishing creek in chester district about the year 1762 he removed to what is now called spartanburg district and settled upon fairforest creek a few miles above the spot where the line dividing that district from union crosses the stream mrs thomas was much beloved and respected in that neighborhood she was one of the first members of the presbyterian congregation organized about that time and known as fairforest church of which she continued a zealous and efficient member as long as she resided within its bounds while her husband was a prisoner at ninetysix she paid a visit to him and her two sons who were his companions in rigorous captivity by chance she overheard a conversation between some tory women the purport of which deeply interested her one said to the others tomorrow night the loyalists intend to surprise the rebels at cedar spring the heart of mrs thomas was thrilled with alarm at this intelligence the cedar spring was within a few miles of her house the whigs were posted there and among them were some of her own children her resolution was taken at once for there was no time to be lost she determined to apprise them of the enemys intention before the blow could be struck bidding a hasty adieu to her husband and sons she was upon the road as quickly as possible rode the intervening distance of nearly sixty miles the next day and arrived in time to bring information to her sons and friends of the impending danger the moment they knew what was to be expected a brief consultation was held and measures were immediately taken for defense the soldiers withdrew a short distance from their campfires which were prepared to burn as brightly as possible the men selected suitable positions in the surrounding woods their preparations were just completed when they heard in the distance amid the silence of night the cautious advance of the foe the scene was one which imagination far better than the pen of the chronicler can depict slowly and warily and with tread as noiseless as possible the enemy advanced till they were already within the glare of the blazing fires and safely as it seemed on the verge of their anticipated work of destruction no sound betrayed alarm they supposed the intended victims wrapped in heavy slumbers they heard but the crackling of the flames and the hoarse murmur of the wind as it swept through the pine trees the assailants gave the signal for the onset and rushed towards the fires eager for indiscriminate slaughter suddenly the flashes and shrill reports of rifles revealed the hidden champions of liberty the enemy to their consternation found themselves assailed in the rear by the party they had expected to strike unawares thrown into confusion by this unexpected reception defeat overwhelming defeat was the consequence to the loyalists they were about one hundred and fifty strong while the whigs numbered only about sixty the victory thus easily achieved they owed to the spirit and courage of a woman such were the matrons of that day not merely upon this occasion was mrs thomas active in conveying intelligence to her friends and in arousing the spirit of independence among its advocates she did as well as suffered much during the period of devastation and lawless rapine one instance of her firmness is well remembered early in the war governor rutledge sent a quantity of arms and ammunition to the house of colonel thomas to be in readiness for any emergency that might arise on the frontier these munitions were under a guard of twentyfive men and the house was prepared to resist assault colonel thomas received information that a large party of tories under the command of colonel more of north carolina was advancing to attack him he and his guard deemed it inexpedient to risk an encounter with a force so much superior to their own and they therefore retired carrying off as much ammunition as possible josiah culbertson a soninlaw of colonel thomas who was with the little garrison would not go with the others but remained in the house besides him and a youth the only inmates were women the tories advanced and took up their station but the treasure was not to be yielded to their demand their call for admittance was answered by an order to leave the premises and their fire was received without much injury by the logs of the house the fire was quickly returned from the upper story and proved much more effectual than that of the assailants the oldfashioned batten door strongly barricaded resisted their efforts to demolish it meanwhile culbertson continued to fire the guns being loaded as fast as he discharged them by the ready hands of mrs thomas and her daughters aided by her son william and this spirited resistance soon convinced the enemy that further effort was useless believing that many men were concealed in the house and apprehending a sally their retreat was made as rapidly as their wounds would permit after waiting a prudent time and reconnoitering as well as she could from her position above mrs thomas descended the stairs and opened the doors when her husband made his appearance and knew how gallantly the plunderers had been repulsed his joy was only equaled by admiration of his wifes heroism the powder thus preserved constituted the principal supply for sumters army in the battles at rocky mount and hanging rock mrs thomas was the mother of nine children and her sons and sonsinlaw were active in american service john the eldest son rose during the war from the rank of captain till he succeeded his father in the command of the spartan regiment this he commanded at the battle of the cowpens and elsewhere he was with sumter in several of his most important engagements robert another son was killed in roebucks defeat abram who was wounded at ninety six and taken prisoner died in the enemys hands william the youth who had assisted in defending his home on the occasion mentioned took part in other actions thus mrs thomas was liable to some share of the enmity exhibited by the royalists towards another matron against whom the charge she has seven sons in the rebel army was an excuse for depredations on her property if she had but four sons she had sonsinlaw who were likewise brave and zealous in the cause martha one of the daughters married josiah culbertson who was the most effective scout in the country he fought the indians singlehanded and in the army was in nearly every important battle and killed a number of celebrated tories in casual encounter he seems to have been a special favorite with colonel isaac shelby in whose regiment he served in the battle at musgroves mill kings mountain and elsewhere to this officer his daring spirit and deadly aim with the rifle especially commended him and he was employed by shelby in the execution of some important trusts he received a captains commission towards the close of the war ann was the wife of joseph mcjunkin who entered the service of his country as a private at the age of twenty and rose to the rank of major before the close of 1780 he was in most of the battles before march 1781 and contributed much to the success of those fought at hanging rock musgroves mill blackstocks fort and the cowpens this brave and faithful officer died in 1840 a sketch of his life by the rev james h saye of south carolina is in preparation and has in part been published jane the third daughter married captain joseph mccool and letitia was the wife of major james lusk both these were brave and efficient patriots but the scenes of their exploits and the success that attended them are now remembered but in tradition of how many who deserve the tribute of their countrys gratitude is history silent every member of this family it will thus be seen had a personal interest in the cause of the country not only was mrs thomas distinguished for her indomitable perseverance where principle and right were concerned and for her ardent spirit of patriotism but for eminent piety discretion and industry her daughters exhibited the same loveliness of character with the uncommon beauty of person which they inherited from her all accounts represent mrs culbertson as a woman of great beauty and her sister ann is said to have been little inferior to her in personal appearance mrs thomas herself was rather below the ordinary stature with black eyes and hair rounded and pleasing features fair complexion and countenance sprightly and expressive soon after the close of the war colonel thomas removed into greenville district where he and his wife resided till their death but few of their descendants remain in the section of country where their parents lived being scattered over the regions of the far west to the gentleman already mentioned as the biographer of mcjunkin i am indebted for all these details ascertained from authentic papers in his possession on another occasion having heard the noise of battle during the afternoon and night she went up early in the morning to leightons a scout consisting of eight whigs had been surrounded by a very large body of tories some of the scouts made their escape by charging through the line four defended themselves in the house till after dark when they surrendered mrs sims on her arrival found that john jolly a whig officer who belonged to the vicinity had been shot in attempting to escape she sent for his wife and made the necessary arrangements for his decent burial sarah his widow was left with five children and for a time had great difficulty in procuring a subsistence her house was visited almost weekly by plundering parties and robbed of food and clothing at one time one of the robbers remained after the others had gone and to an order to depart returned a refusal with abusive and profane language the exasperated mother seized a stick with which she broke his arm and drove him from the premises not long after the death of jolly the famous cunningham a tory colonel who acted a prominent part in the partisan warfare of laurens newberry and edgefield districts came with a squadron of cavalry to the house of captain sims who was gone for safety to north carolina calling mrs sims to the door cunningham ordered her to quit the place in three days saying if he found the family there on his return he would shut them in the house and burn it over them mrs sims fled with her family across the country to the house of a friendly old man and remained there till her husband came and took them to york district and thence to virginia the wife of major samuel otterson a distinguished patriot who lived also on tyger river chanced to know the place where a barrel of powder was concealed in the woods close at hand she received intelligence one night that a party of tories would come for the treasure the next morning resolved that it should not fall into their hands she prepared a train immediately and blew up the powder in the morning came the enemy and on their demand for it were told by mrs otterson what she had done they refused to believe her but cut off her dress at the waist and drove her before them to show the place of deposit the evidence of its fate was conclusive when they reached the spot other instances of female intrepidity are rife in popular memory miss nancy jackson who lived in the irish settlement near fairforest creek kicked a tory down the steps as he was descending loaded with plunder in a great rage he threatened to send the hessian troops there next day which obliged her to take refuge with an acquaintance several miles distant on one occasion the house of samuel mcjunkin a stout patriot but too old for the battlefield was visited by a party under the noted colonel patrick moore they stayed all night and when about to depart stripped the house of bedclothes and wearing apparel the last article taken was a bedquilt which one bill haynesworth placed upon his horse jane mr mcjunkins daughter seized it and a struggle ensued the soldiers amused themselves by exclaiming well done woman  well done bill for once the colonels feelings of gallantry predominated and he swore if jane could take the quilt from the man she should have it presently in the contest bills feet slipped from under him and he lay panting on the ground jane placed one foot upon his breast and wrested the quilt from his grasp for many years previous to the commencement of the revolutionary war mr thomas was a magistrate and a captain of militia before hostilities began he resigned both these commissions when colonel fletcher refused to accept a commission under the authority of the province of south carolina an election was held and john thomas was chosen colonel of the spartan regiment the proximity of this regiment to the frontier imposed a large share of active service on the soldiers belonging to it and devolved great responsibilities upon its commander colonel thomas led out his quota of men to repel the indians in 1776 and shared the privations and dangers connected with the expedition under general williamson into the heart of the indian territory in the autumn of that year when that campaign terminated and the indians sued for peace the protection of a long line of the frontier was entrusted to him with diligence fidelity and zeal did he perform this duty and retained his command till after the fall of charleston as soon as the news of the surrender of that city reached the borders of the state measures were concerted by colonels thomas brandon and lysles for the concentration of their forces with a view to protect the country their schemes were frustrated by the devices of colonel fletcher who still remained in the neighborhood having discovered their intentions he gave notice to some british troops recently marched into the vicinity and to a body of tory cavalry thirty miles distant these were brought together and surprised the force collected by brandon at the point designated before the others had time to arrive within a short time after this event almost every whig between the broad and saluda rivers was compelled to abandon the country or accept british protection numbers of them fled to north carolina colonel thomas then advanced in life with some others in like defenceless circumstances took protection by this course they hoped to secure permission to remain unmolested with their families but in this supposition they were lamentably mistaken it was not long before colonel thomas was arrested and sent to prison at ninetysix thence he was conveyed to charleston where he remained in durance till near the close of the war it was the policy of cornwallis whom sir henry clinton on his departure to new york had left in command of the royal army to compel submission by the severest measures the bloody slaughter under tarleton at waxhaw creek was an earnest of what those who ventured resistance might expect this course was pursued with unscrupulous cruelty and the unfortunate patriots were made to feel the vengeance of exasperated tyranny he hoped thus eventually to crush and extinguish the spirit still struggling and flashing forth like hidden fire among the people whom the arm of power had for a season brought under subjection but the oppressor though he might overawe could not subdue the spirit of a gallant and outraged people the murmur of suffering throughout the land rose ere long into a mighty cry for deliverance the royal standard became an object of execration and while brave leaders were at hand  while the fearless and determined sumter could draw about him the hardy sons of the upper and middle country  while the patriotic marion ever fertile in resource could harass the foe from his impenetrable retreat in the recess of forests and swamps while the resolute and daring pickens could bring his bold associates to join in the noble determination to burst the chains riveted on a prostrate land  and others of the same mould familiar with difficulties accustomed to toil and danger and devoted to the cause of their suffering country were ready for prompt and energetic action hope could be entertained that all was not yet lost the outrages committed by the profligate and abandoned whose loyalty was the cover for deeds of rapine and blood served but to bind in closer union the patriots who watched their opportunity for annoying the enemy and opening a way for successful resistance one of the congenial cooperators in these plans of the british commander was colonel ferguson he encouraged the loyalists to take arms and led them to desolate the homes of their neighbors about the last of june he came into that part of the country where the family of colonel thomas lived and caused great distress by the pillage and devastation of the bands of tories who hung around his camp the whigs were robbed of their negroes horses cattle clothing bedding and every article of property of sufficient value to take away these depredations were frequent the expeditions for plunder being sometimes weekly and were continued as long as the tories could venture to show their faces in this state of things while whole families suffered female courage and

an optical table is a platform that is used to support systems used for optics experiments and engineering the surfaces of these tables are designed to be very rigid so that the alignment of optical elements remains stable over time many optical systems require that vibration of optical elements be kept small as a result optical tables are typically very heavy and incorporate vibrationdamping features in their structure many use pneumatic bearings that act as a highpass filter to vibrations preventing lowfrequency vibrations in the floor from reaching the tabletop the surface of an optical table is typically stainless steel with a rectangular grid of tapped holes in either metric or imperial units optical breadboards benches and rails are simpler structures that perform a similar function to optical tables these are used in teaching and in research and development and are also sometimes used to support permanently aligned optical systems in finished devices in optical systems especially those involving interferometry the alignment of each component must be extremely accurate—precise down to a fraction of a wavelength—usually a few hundred nanometers even small vibrations or strain in the table on which the elements are set up might lead to complete failure of an experiment  hence one requires an extremely rigid table which neither moves nor flexes even under changing loads or vibrations the surface of the table must also be quite flat to allow precision optical mounts to make good contact with the table without rocking and facilitate easy assembly of the optical system earlier optical table tops were sometimes made of a large slab of highly polished granite or diabase these materials are very dense and stiff which inhibits flexing and motion of the surface improving the stability of the optical system the surfaces can be ground extremely flat which is beneficial for alignment of optical systems such tables were very heavy and expensive however and did not do a good job of damping vibrations mounting components to a granite surface is also difficult granite and diabase are still used for smaller precisionflat surfaces but optical tables made from these materials are not commonly available today modern optical tables are typically made of top and bottom sheets of steel aluminum or carbon fiber separated by a thick honeycomb lattice structure the surface usually has a grid of threaded holes which allow the components to be bolted down to fit the optical system layout components may also be held to the steel surface by magnetic bases often the tables legs are pneumatic vibration dampers for even more accurate setups one also prevents air movements and temperature gradients by enclosing the surface in a box of transparent plastic such as plexiglas one may also use a flowbox a device which produces a laminar stream of air flowing downwards kept at constant temperature by special air conditioning the metal used to construct modern optical tables has a higher speed of sound than granite and therefore a higher frequency of the first eigenmode any vibration produced on the table below this frequency does not produce a resonant response making the setup less sensitive to vibrations from motorized optics cooling water pumps etc vibration damping may be added to tables during their construction as with granites composite structure the combination of several stiff materials with different speeds of sound produces a table for which a wide range of vibrations are critically damped viscous fluids are used in between the stiff materials to aid in damping an alternative to an optical table is an optical breadboard some optical systems use breadboards made of solid aluminum for later integration with a larger system with some form of vibration control most optical breadboards are constructed from
steel aluminum or carbon fiber sheets with honeycomb structure and can be placed on an ordinary table or workbench breadboards are not as good as optical tables but weigh less and are adequate for smaller optical systems that do not require extremely high levels of mechanical stability the low weight enables one to support these tables on soft air springs which reduce vibrations coming from the floor although this increases vibrations due to acoustic noise the honeycomb structure reduces bending due to the breadboards own weight so it can be tilted and forces applied via the soft spring supports accelerate the table as a whole without misalignment breadboards can therefore be used in mobile applications such as on airplanes also one can bolt a breadboard onto an optical table build up a module of the experiment on it and then transfer the module as a whole onto another table without the need to realign the components on the breadboard similarly custombuilt optical devices are assembled and aligned on breadboards which are then enclosed in a case and shipped to the customer an optical bench or optical rail is a simpler piece of hardware that provides a linear or sometimes curved track along which to mount optical elements they are often used for simple experiments especially for classroom demonstrations such rails are typically made of steel and designed to be very stiff with features that allow holders for optical components to be bolted down and easily shifted along the length of the rail a more sophisticated example is the silicon carbide ceramic toroidal optical bench in the gaia spacecraft illustrated which supports several optical instruments

 he aint heavy hes my brother is a popular music ballad written by bobby scott and bob russell originally recorded by kelly gordon in 1969 the song became a worldwide hit for the hollies later that year and again for neil diamond in 1970  it has been covered by many artists in subsequent years the hollies version of the song has also been featured in the film zoolander scott and russell had been introduced to each other by johnny mercer at a california nightclub  although russell was dying of lymphoma and the pair met in person only three times they managed to collaborate on the song the publishing rights to the song were the subject of a legal battle following russells deathcitation needed in 1884 james wells moderator of the united free church of scotland in his book the parables of jesus tells the story of a little girl carrying a big baby boy seeing her struggling someone asked if she wasn’t tired with surprise she replied “no he’s not heavy he’s my brother” in an 1918 publication by ralph waldo trine titled the higher powers of mind and spirit he relates the following anecdote do you know that incident in connection with the little scottish girl she was trudging along carrying as best she could a boy younger but it seemed almost as big as she herself when one remarked to her how heavy he must be for her to carry when instantly came the reply hes na heavy hes mi brither the first editor of kiwanis magazine roe fulkerson published a column in september 1924 carrying the title he aint heavy hes my brother the first use of the phrase exactly as it is rendered in the song title the phrase is also associated with father edward j flanagan the founder of boys town flanagan came across a line drawing of a young boy carrying his brother in the christmas 1941 edition of the louis allis messenger the caption read he aint heavy mister—hes m brother it was created by mr van b hooper who later became the editor of ideals the drawing was reprinted in the first issue of ideals in december 1944 flanagan felt that the drawing illustrated the work done at boys town and received permission from the company in august 1943 to recreate the drawing in color with the caption he aint heavy father    hes m brother the phrase became the motto of boys towncitation needed the statement is a use of paraprosdokian a figure of speech in which the second half of the statement causes the hearer to reinterpret the first part often used for comedic effect this is a rare use of the form as pathos the hollies recording which featured elton john on piano was released in the uk on 1 september 1969 and on 1 december 1969 in the us he aint heavy reached 3 in the uk and 7 in the us the song paired with carrie was rereleased in late 1988 in the uk following its use in a television advertisement for miller lite beer it reached the 1 spot in the uk chart for two weeks in september 1988 in ireland the hollies version of the song entered the charts twice on its first entry in october 1969 it peaked at 3 and spent 10 weeks in the charts and on its second entry in september 1988 as a result of its miller lite advertisement usage it peaked at 2 neil diamonds version of the song recorded for his tap root manuscript album went to 20 on the billboard hot 100 singles chart in late 1970 the osmonds covered the song in 1971  it was a staple at concerts and was on their first pop album the neil diamond version bowed at 68 on the hot 100 on 7 november 1970  uni records 55264 length 247 the flip side was free life the song appears on the neil diamond album tap root manuscript which was released 21 november 1970 the song was played by kgbam radio san diego california in late 1970 prior to the thennew walk for mankind in dedication to those who would be walking for donations that day in 2012 a version of the song was recorded and was released on december 17 2012 by musicians and celebrities going under the name the justice collective including melanie c robbie williams paul heaton paloma faith paul mccartney gerry marsden kenny dalglish alan hansen rebecca ferguson beverley knight and two original members of the hollies bobby elliott and tony hicks for various charities associated with the hillsborough disaster the song went on to take the coveted christmas number one position for 2012 on the uk singles chart beating the x factor winner james arthur who was number one the previous week the single gave melanie c her twelfth numberone hit on the uk singles chart making her the only female artist to reach number one in a quintet quartet duo solo and ensemble and also the female artist featured on the most 1 christmas singles following the three she achieved with the spice girls 2 become 1 too much and goodbyecitation needed after the

this they formed the justice tonight band and toured the united kingdom and europe for the next year in order to raise awareness of the hillsborough justice campaign initially the idea was to rerelease the 2009 single the fields of anfield road by the liverpool collective featuring the kop choir however this idea was rejected by peter hooton as only a relatively small number of people would buy it inspired by evertons hillsborough tribute on 17 september 2012 the song was played at goodison park prior to their match against newcastle united it was then decided that a rerecording of this song by various artists including the justice tonight band would be released as the charity single keith mullen of the farm recruited guy chambers to produce the single and with chambers offering free use of his sleeper studios to record the song on 25 october steve rotheram guy chambers and kenny dalglish announced plans of the single to be recorded by various artists such as robbie williams

queen elizabeths corgis are the welsh corgi dogs owned by queen elizabeth ii and her parents queen elizabeth the queen mother and king george vi  fond of corgis since she was a small child elizabeth ii has owned more than 30 corgis since she became queen of the united kingdom and the other commonwealth realms in 1952 the queen mother introduced a disciplined regimen for the dogs each was to have its own wicker basket raised above the floor to avoid draughts meals were served for each dog in its own dish the diet approved by veterinary experts with no titbits from the royal table the corgis

escort the queen to the event monty had previously belonged to the queen mother and died soon after in september 2012 the royal corgis are known all across the world and have been portrayed in many ways such as statues and works of art  for example the crown coin which commemorated the queens golden jubilee shows her with a corgi the queen has been very fond of corgis since she was a small child having fallen in love with the corgis owned by the children of the marquess of bath king george vi brought home dookie in 1933 a photograph from george vis photo album shows a tenyearold elizabeth with dookie at balmoral princess elizabeth and her sister princess margaret would feed dookie by hand from a dish held by a footman the other early favourite corgi during the same time was jane crackers 24 december 1939 windsor  november 1953 was one of the queen mothers corgis and nearly a constant companion he retired with the queen mother to the castle of mey in scotland in 1944 elizabeth was given susan as a gift on her 18th birthday susan accompanied elizabeth on her honeymoon in 1947 the corgis owned by the queen are descended from susan rozavel sue daughter of rozavel lucky strike an international champion was one of the queens corgis in the early 1950s the queen has owned over thirty corgis since her accession to the thrones of the united kingdom and the other commonwealth realms in 1952 the queens fondness for corgis and horses is known even in places such as grand cayman when elizabeth and prince philip visited the island in 1983 government officials gave her black coral sculptures of a corgi and a horse as a gift both made by bernard passman sugar was the nursery pet of prince charles and princess anne in 1955 her pups whisky and sherry were surprise christmas gifts from the queen to the prince and princess pictured with the royal family the corgi sugar made the cover of the australian womens weekly on 10 june 1959 sugars twin honey belonged to the queen mother honey took midday runs with johnny and pippin princess margarets corgis while the princess lived in buckingham palace heather was born in 1962 and became one of the queens favourites heather was the mother of tiny bushy and foxy foxy gave birth to brush in 1969 the queen mother introduced a disciplined regimen for the royal corgis each dog was to have its own wicker basket the bed raised above the floor to escape draughts meals were served for each dog in its own dish the diet approved by veterinary experts with no tidbits from the royal table a proprietary brand of meat dog biscuits was served in the morning while the late afternoon meal consisted of dog meal with gravy extra biscuits were handed out for celebrations and rewards the corgis enjoy a privileged life in buckingham palace they reside in the corgi room and continue to sleep in elevated wicker baskets the queen tends to the corgis in her kennel herself she also chooses the sires of litters that are bred in her kennel the corgis have an extensive menu at the palace which includes fresh rabbit and beef served by a gourmet chef at christmas the queen makes stockings for pets full of toys and delicacies such as biscuits in 1999 one of queen elizabeths royal footmen was demoted from buckingham palace for his party trick of pouring booze into the corgis food and water and watching them staggering about with relish in 2007 the queen was noted to have five corgis monty emma linnet willow and holly five cocker spaniels bisto oxo flash spick and span and four dorgis dachshundcorgi crossbreeds cider berry

the 2012 summer olympics opening ceremony monty who had previously belonged to the queen mother and one of her dorgis died in september 2012 as of november 2012 it was reported that elizabeth owns two corgis willow and holly and two dorgis candy and vulcan the dogs have traditionally been buried at the royal residence sandringham estate in norfolk at which they died the graveyard was firstly used by queen victoria when her collie noble died in 1887 in 1959 the queen used it to bury susan creating a cemetery for her pets however monty was buried in balmoral estate on several occasions the queen or her staff have been injured by the corgis in 1954 the royal clockwinder leonard hubbard was bitten by susan upon entering the nursery at the royal lodge windsor later in the same year one of the queen mothers corgis bit a policeman on guard duty in london in 1968 peter doig called for the royal staff to put up a beware of dogs sign at balmoral after one of the corgis bit the postman in february 1989 it was reported that the royals had hired an animal psychologist to tame the dogs after they developed a habit of nipping them and the royal staff in march 1991 the queen was bitten after trying to break up a fight between ten or so of her corgis she had to have three stitches to her left hand john collins the queen mothers chauffeur had to have a tetanus injection after he also tried to intervene in 2003 pharos a tenthgeneration offspring of susan was put down after being mauled by princess annes english bull terrier dottie anne arrived at sandringham to visit her mother for

the nahe valley railway german nahetalbahn is a twotrack partially electrified main line railway in the german states of rhinelandpalatinate and saarland it was built by the rhinenahe railway company and connects bingen am rhein on the left rhine line with saarbrücken it was opened between 1858 and 1860 and is one of the oldest railways in germany the section south of bad kreuznach is part of the regionally important transport corridor between the two major cities of mainz and saarbrücken in 1839 there were plans to build a rail link between the saar and the rhine river which could not be realised because of its high construction costs in 1856 construction of the line was undertaken by the private rhinenahe railway company rheinnahe eisenbahngesellschaft rne set up for this purpose it would connect the nahe valley and the surrounding area with the left rhine line of the rhenish railway company rheinischen eisenbahngesellschaft rhe and the hessian ludwig railway hessische ludwigsbahn in bingerbrück and would stimulate economic development and open up the market for saar coal by connecting the saarland railways with the middle rhine valley it was proposed that the line be privately financed with a government guarantee of a return of four percent the prussian government took control of the project on 18 june 1856 and issued the concession for the railway’s construction and operation to the company on 4 september 1856 contracts were signed to allow the line to run through meisenheim part of landgrave of hessehomburg and the principality of birkenfeld part of the grand duchy of oldenburg allowing construction of the 120 km long line to begin in 1857 the first 16 km section from bingerbrück now bingen hauptbahnhof to bad kreuznach went into operation on 15 july 1858 this was followed by the sections to oberstein on 15 december 1859 and to neunkirchen saar via birkenfeld now neubrücke and st wendel on 26 may 1860 with a total length of 52 or 53 km even before the construction the line was finished the royal railway administration at saarbrücken königliche eisenbahndirection zu saarbrücken took over its management and operation the railway was considered a regional lifeline that would promote industrialisation in this agricultural area of the upper blies valley and the nahe valley which was affected by high unemployment rural exodus and emigration in neunkirchen there was a connection with the royal saarbrücken railway the line connected on the rhine in bingerbrück with the left rhine line opened by the rhenish railway company on 17 october 1859 this was followed by a connection with the hessian ludwig railway to mainz on 15 december 1859 at the beginning of november 1861 this was followed by the opening of the bingerbrück–rüdesheim train ferry connecting to the nassau rhine railway opened in 1856 by the wiesbaden railway company wiesbadener eisenbahngesellschaft which was nationalised in 1861 as the nassau state railway nassauische staatsbahn the 121 km long line of the rhinenahe railway company was called by arthur von mayer the most expensive line in germany this was the result of its very difficult construction which included a large number of tunnels bridges embankments and cuttings the construction cost more than one million thalers per prussian mile 75325 metres then a record sum the revenue of the company after the start of operations was well short of expectations since the passenger traffic met the expectations of the builders only to the spas of kreuznach and münster neither dividends nor interest on debt could be paid 
as a result the prussian government was obliged to step in to meet its annual interest rate guarantee this also meant that the government was unable to sell the line to the rhenish railway after the war of 1866 the birkenfeld station was five kilometres from the capital of the principality of birkenfeld therefore the town and degussa gmbh funded the construction of a railway from the town of birkenfeld to neubrücke the original birkenfeld was renamed neubrücke station rne took over the management of the birkenfeld railway and opened it on 5 october 1880 as the line formed part of a route to the french border it was soon duplicated the line was connected to the hindenburg bridge which was built between rüdesheim am rhein and bingenkempten for strategic reasons the bridge was built between 1913 and 1915 and destroyed in 1945 it connected a junction in münstersarmsheim on the nahe valley railway with the right rhine line because of the great military importance of the line the rne was acquired by the prussian government with effect of 1 april 1881 and the company was dissolved from 1 july 1883 it was part of the royal railway administration at cologne left rhine königlichen eisenbahndirektion köln linksrheinisch of the prussian state railways coal was mined near the original bildstock tunnel 481 m and a pillar of coal had to be left in place to support the foundations of the tunnel the former saargruben later saarbergwerke ag today dsk mining company wanted to remove this to extend its mine in 1955 therefore the new bildstock tunnel 341 m was built with an improved 600 m radius bypassing the former tunnel on 16 january 1918 the embankment between kirn and hochstetten nahe was washed away during a storm by the nahe and subsided this caused the derailment of leave train 243 causing the locomotive van and three passenger carriages to plunge into the river 38 people were killed and 25 wounded between bad kreuznach and türkismühle the route runs primarily on the north side of the nahe the line crosses the nahe twice in the four km section between bad kreuznach and bad münster and eleven times between bad münster and idaroberstein the line runs along the blies between st wendel and neunkirchen saar hbf the nahe valley railway runs largely parallel to federal highway 41 and their paths cross several times the first crossing takes place north of bad kreuznach the railway and highway run parallel from bad sobernheim through the nahe valley until the road leaves the valley in the idaroberstein district of enzweiler the railway and road also run parallel on a second much shorter section between neubrücke nahe and nohfelden south of namborn the railway line crosses the road again and the two run parallel with the course of the blies between st wendel and

the south african class 6e1 series 9 of 1981 is a south african electric locomotive from the south african railways era in 1981 and 1982 the south african railways placed eightyfive class 6e1 series 9 electric locomotives with a bobo wheel arrangement in mainline service the 3 kv dc class 6e1 series 9 electric locomotive was designed and built for the south african railways sar by union carriage and wagon ucw in nigel transvaal with the electrical equipment supplied by the general electric company gec eightyfive series 9 locomotives were delivered in 1981 and 1982 numbered in the range from e2001 to e2085 ucw did not allocate builder’s or works numbers to the locomotives it built for the sar but used the sar running numbers for their record keeping the class 6e1 was built with sophisticated traction linkages on their bogies and with stabilisers mounted between the linkages on the bogies and the locomotive body together with its electronic wheelslip detection system these traction linkages and stabilisers ensured the maximum transfer of power to the rails without causing wheelslip these dual cab locomotives had a roof access ladder on one side only just to the right of the cab access door the roof access ladder end was marked as the number 2 end the cabs were connected by a passage along the centre of the locomotive the class 6e1 was produced in eleven series over a period of nearly sixteen years with altogether nine hundred and sixty units placed in service all built by ucw this makes the class 6e1 the most numerous single locomotive class ever to have seen service in south africa and serves as ample proof of a highly successful design while some of the class 6e1 series were visually indistinguishable from their predecessors or successors some externally visible changes did occur over the years series 1 locomotives had their sandboxes mounted on the bogies while series 2 to 11 had their sandboxes mounted along the bottom edge of the locomotive body with the sandbox lids fitting into recesses in the body series 8 and later locomotives could be distinguished from all older models by the large hatch door on each side below the second small window to the right of the side door on the roof access ladder side and below the first window immediately to the right of the door on the other side the series 9 to series 11 locomotives were visually indistinguishable from each other but could be distinguished from all earlier models by the rainwater drainage holes on their lower sides these holes were usually covered by socalled buckets but the covers were absent on a few locomotives another distinction was the end doors that were recessed into the doorframes on series 9 to series 11 locomotives compared to earlier models that had their end doors flush with the doorframes in addition on series 9 and later the split side window on the driver’s assistant side was replaced by a single rectangular side window with rounded corners finally unlike all earlier models all four doors on series 9 to series 11 locomotives had rounded corners the classes 5e 5e1 6e and 6e1 locomotives are notoriously difficult to enter from ground level since their leverstyle door handles are at waist level when standing inside the locomotive making it impossible to open the door from outside without first climbing up high enough to reach the door handle while hanging on to the side handrails with one hand only crews therefore often choose to leave the doors ajar when parking and exiting the locomotives side doors with two interconnected latch handles on the outside such as those that were introduced on the class 7e1 with one outside handle mounted near floor level and the other at middoor level were also introduced on class 6e1 locomotives beginning with series 9 the class 6e1 family saw service all over both of the transnet freight rail tfr 3 kv dc mainline and branchline networks the smaller cape western network between cape town and beaufort west and the larger network that covers portions of the northern cape the free state natal gauteng north west province and mpumalanga during 1990 and 1991 spoornet semipermanently coupled several pairs of otherwise largely unmodified class 6e1 locomotives reclassified them to class 16e and allocated a single running number to each pair with the individual locomotives in the pairs inscribed a or b the aim was to accomplish savings on cab maintenance by coupling the locomotives at their number 1 ends abandoning the number one end cabs in terms of maintenance and using only the number two end cabs most were later either disbanded with the locomotives reverting to class 6e1 and regaining their original numbers or getting rebuilt to class 18e the first two series 9 locomotives numbers e2001 and e2002 were built as experimental logic control locomotives they were also the only two series 9 locomotives to be reclassified and renumbered to class 16e becoming number 16500a and b class 17e locomotives were modified and reclassified from class 6e1 series 7 8 or 9 locomotives during 1993 and 1994 key modifications included improved regenerative braking and wheel slip control to improve their reliability on the steep gradients and curves of the natal mainline unlike the unmodified but reclassified class 16e locomotives the class 17es retained their original running numbers after reclassification seventy series 9 locomotives were reclassified to class 17e beginning in 2000 spoornet started a project of rebuilding series 2 to 11 class 6e1 locomotives to class 18e series 1 and series 2 at the transnet rail engineering tre workshops at koedoespoort in the process the cab at the number 1 end was stripped of all controls in order to have a toilet installed thereby forfeiting the locomotives bidirectional ability by june 2007 all series 9 locomotives except class 17e no e2035 and class 6e1 no e2049 were rebuilt to class 18e series 1 the fate of the two exceptions is not known and they are presumed to have been scrapped all the class 6e1 series 9 locomotives were delivered new in the sar gulf red and yellow whiskers livery the main picture shows number e2007 in the spoornet lined orange livery at kirk falls in kwazulunatal on 3 march 2004 illustrated below are some of the other liveries that series 9 locomotives served in no e2030 in sar gulf

the mythopoetic mens movement sometimes mistakenly referred to simply as the mens movement which is much broader refers to a loose collection of organizations active in mens work since the early 1980s  the mythopoetic mens movement grew as a reaction to the secondwave feminist movement  the mythopoetic mens movement aims to liberate men from the constraints of the modern world which keep them from being in touch with their true masculine nature and is best known for the rituals that take place during their gatherings  while in the public eye in the early 1990s the movement carries on more quietly in the mankind project and independent psychologicospiritual practitioners  mythopoets adopted a general style of psychological selfhelp inspired by the work of robert bly robert a johnson joseph campbell and other jungian authorscitation needed the leaders of the mythopoetic mens movement believed that modernization had led to the feminization of men  mythopoets believed that the rise of the urban industrial society trapped men into straitjackets of rationality thus blunting the powerful emotional communion and collective spiritual transcendence that they believe men in tribal societies typically enjoyed p 20 messner  most importantly the movement sought to restore the deep masculine to men who had lost it in their more modern lifestyles
other causes for the loss of the deep masculine include the mythopoetic mens movement spawned a variety of selfhelp groups and workshops led by authors such as robert bly michael j meade and robert l moore  among its most famous advocates was the poet bly whose book iron john a book about men 1990 spent 62 weeks on the the new york times best seller list being an exegesis of the fairy tale iron john by the brothers grimm  groups of primarily white middleaged heterosexual men from the professional class retreated from their female loved ones in order to join in spiritual rituals that emphasized homosociality with the central goal of reclaiming the parts of their masculinity that they had lost called the deep masculine because most men no longer perform masculine rituals mythopoets assert that men have mutated into destructive hypermasculine chauvinists or in the opposite direction have become too feminized  the mythopoetic men performed rituals at these gatherings which were meant to imitate those performed by tribal societies when men initiated boys into a deeply essential natural manhood  the movement emphasized the importance of including multiple generations of men in the rituals so that the men could learn about masculinity from those who were older and wiser characteristic of the early mythopoetic movement was a tendency to retell myths legends and folktales and engage in their exegesis as a tool for personal insight  using frequent references to archetypes as drawn from jungian analytical psychology the movement focused on issues of gender role gender identity and wellness for the modern man and woman  advocates would often engage in storytelling with music these acts being seen as a modern extension to a form of new age shamanism popularized by michael harner at approximately the same time  the movement sought to empower men by means of equating archetypal characters with their own emotions and abilities  for instance michael messner describes the concept of zeus energy as emphasizing male authority accepted for the good of the community  beliefs about the emotional system based in archetypes of great men mythopoets sought to channel these characters in themselves so that they could unleash their animalmales  this group primarily analyzed the archetypes of king warrior magician lover and wildman some academic work came from the movement as well as the creation of various magazines continuing annual conferences based on robert blys vision for creative communities such as minnesota mens conference and the great mother and new father conference and nonprofit organizations doing related work like the mankind project and micheal meades mosaic multicultural foundation mythopoetic practices among womens groups and feminists were more commonly seen as part of a more general womens spirituality as a selfhelp movement the mythopoetic movement tends not to take explicit stances on political issues such as feminism gay rights or family law such as the issues of divorce domestic violence or child custody preferring instead to stay focused on emotional and psychological wellbeing  because of this neutrality the movement became a site of social criticism by feminists and was often characterized as antiintellectual as well as apolitical michael messner once gave a speech at a gathering in which he addressed the dangers of celebrating the warrior as instances of rape are higher in countries that glorify war the mythopoets responded that they were not interested in intellectual or political pursuits but were primarily concerned with conducting spiritual and emotional work additional feminist critique revolved around the movements absence of womens perspectives as well as the essentialism in the movements teachings

beta scission is an important reaction in the chemistry of thermal cracking of hydrocarbons and the formation of free radicals free radicals are formed upon splitting the carboncarbon bond  free radicals are extremely reactive and shortlived when a free radical in a polymer chain undergoes a beta scission the free radical breaks two carbons away from the charged carbon producing an olefin ethylene and a primary free radical which has two fewer carbon atoms in organic synthesis beta scission can be used to direct multistep radical transformations for example betascission of a weak cs bond was used to favor one of two equilibrating radicals in metal free conversion of phenols to aromatic esters and acids via co transposition

architecture the interpretation of this incident is still debated the communists in kerala maintain this as a struggle for freedom against the oppression of the state by the diwan some individuals argue this was neither an uprising or a liberation struggle they suggest certain communist leaders instigated the coir workers belonging to the ezhava community to wage a war against the then administration led by c p ramaswami iyer t k varghese vaidya a leader of the struggle had even gone on record saying it was a rehearsal for a larger revolution with the ultimate objective of establishing a communist india however the qualified historians like prof a sreedhara menon confirm that it was indeed a proper political struggle by the communists against the travancore government in 1946 iyer the diwan of travancore proposed constitutional reforms which the communists opposed saying its for the creation of an american model of executive in travancore the communists opposed this move with the slogan american modal arabi kadalil chuck the american model into the arabian sea the region around alleppey was a communist stronghold and the communist workers organised a mass upheaval in october 1946 against the authority of the diwan and practically established their own government in the region  this led to attacks and deaths of travancore police officials and government officials in that region dismayed by the turn of events the diwan declared martial law in alleppy on october 25 1946 the travancore army moved from their camp and surrounded the communists at vayalar by 27 october the travancore navy supported the army in isolating vayalar which is surrounded by water on three sides once the blockade was in place the army moved in it is estimated that at least 150 people were killed on the spot during the armys pincer movement on october 27 and many more succumbed to injuries later on the same same day at least 130 people were killed in army firings elsewhere in the district the local people and press maintain that many more people were killed and the bodies disposed by the army historians like a sreedhara menon estimates that over a thousand people were killed during the punnapravayalar outbreak atrocities were not one sided and there are reports of murders of travancore policemen after they had surrendered to the communists during the early stages of the disturbances police inspector velayudhan nadar had moved forward to reason out with the communists but he was brutally stabbed to death this hardened the stance of the police and the armed forces following the suppression of the communist local governments the travancore police used heavyhanded methods to repress the political movement in the region and detained many activists without any trial the killings of communist comrades turned the communists and even many noncommunists totally against iyer when on june 3 1947 united kingdom accepted demands for a partition and announced its intention to quit india within a short period the maharaja of travancore desired to declare himself independent supported by the diwan c p chithira thirunal issued a declaration of independence on june 18 1947 as travancores declaration of independence was unacceptable to india negotiations were started with the diwan by the government of india family sources indicate that c p himself was not in favour of independence but only greater autonomy and that a favourable agreement had been reached between c p and the indian representatives by july 23 1947 and accession to the indian union could not be carried out only because it was pending approval by the maharaja communist party of india communist party of india marxist socialist unity centre of india communist nevertheless an assassination attempt was made on c p by a brahmin youth named kcs mani who was an activist of the socialist group led by n sreekantan nair on july 25 1947 during a concert commemorating the anniversary of swathi thirunal ramaswami aiyer survived with multiple slashes on his face and neck and the attack hastened the accession of travancore state to the union of india soon after his recovery citations bibliography

a urethral stricture  is a narrowing of the urethra caused by injury or disease such as urinary tract infections or other forms of urethritis during the early stages of the condition the subject may experience pain during urination and the inability to fully empty the bladder it is not uncommon for the bladders capacity to significantly increase due to this inability to completely void urethral strictures may cause problems with urination including in certain cases the complete inability to urinate which is a medical emergency additionally a urinary tract infection is often present at or prior to initial diagnosis antibiotics quinolone class antiinfective agents or a combination of trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole are often employed as the initial stage of treatment occasionally some degree of relief from straining or improvement of the urinary stream depending on the severity of the stricture occurs with antibiotic treatment due to the reduction of urethral inflammation urethral strictures are generally caused by either injuryrelated trauma to the tract or by a viral or bacterial infection of the tract often caused by certain sexually transmitted infections stis the bodys attempt to repair the damage caused by the injury or infection creates a buildup of scar tissue in the tract resulting in a significant narrowing or even closure of the passage instrumentation of the urethra particularly before the advent of flexible uroendoscopy was—and remains—an important causative event short strictures in the bulbar urethra particularly between the proximal 13 and distal 23 of the bulb may be congenital they probably form as a membrane at the junction between the posterior and anterior urethral segments it is not usually noticeable until later in life as it fails to widen as the urethra does with growth thus it only impedes urinary flow relative to the rest of the urethra after puberty moreover the patient will often not know any different and so will not complain about poor flow the urethra runs between the legs very close to the skin leaving it vulnerable to trauma  simply falling off a bike and hitting between the legs may result in the formation of scar tissue within the urethra tract  this condition is often not found until the patient has problems urinating because these are painless growths of scar tissue passage of kidney stones through the urethra can be painful and subsequently can lead to urethral strictures in infants and toddlers urethral strictures can result from inflammation following a circumcision and may not be noticeable until toilet training when a deflected stream is observed or when the child must strain to produce a urinary stream because of the high rate of recurrence urethral stricture disease is often a lifetimelong diagnosis even after successful surgical resolution of the stricture patients should be monitored and treated for urinary tract infection including patient instruction and education on detection of the symptoms of uti and undergo a noninvasive uroflowmetric study at annual intervals for at least five years post surgery additionally after age 40 it is recommended that the prostate be monitored in males at intervals as determined by the medical practitioner overseeing the situation although no formal studies are available documenting this there appears to be a slightly higher incidence of prostatitis in stricture patients versus the general population patient education and counseling is an important aspect of the successful resolution and continued care for the stricture patient the wake forest institute of regenerative medicine has pioneered the first bioengineered human urethra and in 2006 implanted urethral tissue grown on bioabsorbable scaffolding approximating the size and shape of the affected areas in five young human males who suffered from congenital defects physical trauma or an unspecified disorder necessitating urethral reconstruction as of march 2011 all five recipients report the transplants have functioned well m uri anatphysdevpcell nocoacbacongtumr sysiepon urte procitvp drug g4b blte urte

the most important buildings for modern architecture the seagram building transformed its midtown site the development of tall buildings and the history of architecture other architects replicated details from seagram within new york and around the world for decades following its completion in the late 1950s the bronze extrusions attached to the mullions are exemplary of this trend in tall building design and can be seen in many cities the metlife building formerly the pan am building was the largest commercial office building in the world when it opened on 7 march 1963 it is an

street and lexington avenue in midtown manhattan it is considered one of the most important postwar skyscrapers to be in erected in new york city the striking design of the steeply slanted roof the sleek aluminumclad façade and its base on four stilts over a church also on the site made the skyscraper an instant architectural icon the sloping roof houses the buildings mechanical and ventilation systems the designers settled on an aluminumclad façade to reduce the weight load on the buildings foundation and support structures since its entire weight would be supported by stilts however this did not come without a price when the building was erected in 1977 it was discovered that the lightweight façade made the building vulnerable to swaying under high wind conditions concerned that the building might tip over in very high winds the buildings engineers installed a tuned mass damper in the roof which acts as a counterbalance to the buildings swaying time warner center is a mixeduse skyscraper at columbus circle on manhattans upper west side it has attracted much attention as the first major building to be completed since the september 11th terrorist attacks and has become known

architecture c 1899 in dyker heights brooklyn the dakota building on the upper west side of manhattan tenement buildings in the lower east side brownstone townhouses in harlem apartment buildings in hells kitchen as new york city grew it spread outward from where it originally began at the southerntip of manhattan island into surrounding areas in order to house the burgeoning population farm land and open space in upper manhattan the bronx queens brooklyn and staten island were developed into neighborhoods of brownstones apartment buildings multifamily and singlefamily homes the density of this new construction generally depended on the areas proximity and accessibility to manhattan the development of these areas was often spurred by the opening of bridges and the connection of boroughs via public transportation for example the brooklyn bridge was completed in 1883 and connects brooklyn and manhattan across the east river brooklyn heights a nabe on the brooklyn waterfront is often credited as the united states first suburb the bridge allowed an easier commute between brooklyn and manhattan and spurred rapid construction development and redevelopment the verrazanonarrows bridge completed in 1964 opened up many areas of staten island to residential and commercial development especially in the central and southern parts of the borough which had previously been largely undeveloped staten islands population doubled from about 221000 in 1960 to about 443000 in 2000 by 1870 stone and brick had become firmly established as the building materials of choice as the construction of woodframe houses had been greatly limited in the aftermath of the great fire of 1835 unlike paris which for centuries was built from its own limestone bedrock new york has always drawn its building stone from a network of quarries sometimes quite distant which is evident in the variety of textures and hues of stone seen in the citys buildings in the days before rail stones were floated down the hudson river or along the atlantic seaboard from pits in new england while trains brought marble from vermont and granite from minnesota it was connecticut brownstone that was so popular in the construction of new yorks row homes in late 19th century the that the term brownstone became synonymous with row house beginning in the 1950s public housing projects dramatically changed the citys appearance new large scale frequently highrise residential complexes replaced older communities at times removing artifacts and landmarks that would now be considered of historic value during this period many of these new projects were built in an effort towards urban renewal championed by the famed urban planner robert moses the resulting housing projects have suffered from inconsistent funding poor maintenance and high crime prompting many to consider these projects a failure a distinctive feature of residential and many commercial buildings in new york city is the presence of wooden roofmounted water towers which were required on all buildings higher than six stories by city ordinance in the 19th century because the municipal water pipes could not withstand the extraordinarily high pressure necessary to deliver water to the top stories of highrise buildings whitestone bridge high bridge brooklyn bridge manhattan bridge queensboro bridge williamsburg bridge new york city is located on one of the worlds largest natural harbors the boroughs of manhattan and staten island are their own islands while queens and brooklyn are located at the westend of the larger long island this precipitates a need for an extensive infrastructure of bridges and tunnels nearly all of the citys major bridges and several of its tunnels have broken or set records for example the holland tunnel was the worlds first vehicular tunnel when it opened in 1927 the queensboro bridge is an important piece of cantilever architecture the towers of the brooklyn bridge are built of limestone granite and rosendale cement their architectural style is neogothic with characteristic pointed arches above the passageways through the stone towers this bridge was also the longest suspension bridge in the world from its opening until 1903 and the first steelwire suspension bridge the manhattan bridge throgs neck bridge triborough bridge and verrazano bridge are all examples of structural expressionism formulated in the commissioners plan of 1811 new york adopted a visionary proposal to develop manhattan north of 14th street with a regular street grid the economic logic underlying the plan which called for twelve numbered avenues running north and south and 155 orthogonal cross streets was that the grids regularity would provide an efficient means to
