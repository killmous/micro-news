as tex dinoco with bullhorns as a diecast car in the films credits he is simply tex he speaks with a hoosier accent and resembles the gold longhorn cadillacs at the big texan steak ranch in amarillo  he is the kings manager and sponsor unlike lightnings agent harv who does not watch the race tex is an avid race fan who would never miss a race a supportive and long-time friend of both lynda and the king he has been a loyal fan of the 43 car for many years and boasts that the king has made dinoco proud after chick hicks wins by employing an illegal pit maneuver to sabotage the king in the final lap of the tiebreaker sending the dinoco blue 43 car into a dangerous rollover crash tex offers the lucrative sponsorship to lightning with the explanation that theres a whole lot more to racing than just winning this is an echo of a line that mcqueen used at the end of the race shown at the start of the film but with an entirely different meaning the dinoco transport helicopter is based on a bell 430  without a speaking part he has no voice actor and is not named in the closing credits his name is rotor turbosky in apparent reference to helicopter maker sikorsky  in the die-cast cars toy collection he is seen on top of the dinoco tent during the races mater gets a ride over radiator springs at the end of the film a favour which lightning had promised mater earlier when dreaming of the big trophy and the big sponsor dinoco with the fancy helicopter chick hicks voiced by michael keaton  is a generic pixar design a stock 1980s american car according to pixar publicity coordinator amanda sorena  but strongly resembles a gm g-body  with features from both the chevrolet monte carlo and the buick grand national  as the real-life general motors wanted nothing to do with the character rejecting an initial pixar proposal to cast a chevrolet stock car as the movies villain chick is effectively an orphan  he has spent his entire career trailing strip the king weathers and is bitter about this fact his sponsor is the hostile takeover bank his pit crew are disrespectful to guido underestimating him for being tiny although his skills are shown to be far more superior to their own  chicks racing number 86 is a reference to the year 1986 when pixar studios was founded 86 is also a known slang term for destroying or getting rid of something determined to do whatever it takes to win  hicks will often ram other cars or use the pit manoeuvre  to try to cause racing incidents for his own benefit he despises mcqueen but tends to copy him and adopts the nickname thunder which mcqueen originally used as a put-down mcqueen because thunder always comes after lightning other than his hatred towards mcqueen hicks also appears to hate the king as hicks himself always comes in behind him in second place while mcqueen is presumed missing hicks attempts to take away mcqueens fans on the final lap of the tie-breaker race hicks determined not to come in behind weathers again rams the older racer violently sending the king flying off the track into a devastating and horrifying roll-over wreck on the in-field he expects a huge ovation after mcqueen deliberately gives up the piston cup so he would help the king but an angered crowd and media snub his victory branding him as a cheater he is pelted with discarded tires and confetti and he is booed off the stage with his trophy in humiliation the immediate backlash is similar to backlash against rusty wallace after he spun out darrell waltrip in turn 4 during segment 3 lap 9 of sprint all-star race v 1989 at charlotte motor speedway  sending waltrip spinning into the grass in the film a lucrative corporate sponsorship is at stake hicks and mcqueen share the same dream of being the new face of dinoco oil a firm long represented by retiring champion 43 the king  both race on the assumption that winning the championship cup will land them the big sponsor dinoco is owned by tex a loyal fan and close friend of the king who believes that theres a whole lot more to racing than just winning tex is at every race start to finish cheering on the contestants and watching much more than just the scoreboard when tex offers the lucrative dinoco sponsorship to mcqueen even though mcqueen decides to stay at rust-eeze this is chicks comeuppance and defeat chick reappears in the cars video game where he is caught spying on lightnings practice sessions he ineffectively taunts lightning before the first race of the season until doc warns him off then falls in with a gang of new york-based greaser cars in carburetor county to challenge mcqueen the drh gang jumps mack on the interstate to steal mcqueens racing gear but finger chick as the one who hired them when caught by the sheriff in the cars race-o-rama video game he seeks revenge by closing down mcqueens racing academy to open his own in radiator springs although he gets defeated when you beat him in the final level his catchphrase is ka-chick-ah a blatant rip-off of mcqueens catchphrase ka-chow chick hicks does not appear in cars 2  but he appears in the video game as a downloadable character  besides him there is a similar character named ripslinger in the 2013 cars spin off movie planes  the sheriff voiced by route 66 historian and author michael wallis  is a 1949 mercury eight police car  bearing carburetor county license plate 001  sheriff is painted in the classic law enforcement black and white with a single red light dome two sirens  and curb feelers  sheriff was the first resident of radiator springs to appear in the original film and the first to meet lightning mcqueen during a police chase when mcqueen was speeding through the town trying to find mack  upon catching mcqueen who had become ensnared in wires and fencing sheriff paraphrases a line used by actor joe higgins who played a sheriff in early 1970s dodge commercials as boy youre in a heap of trouble  sheriff was known to distrust mcqueen at one point when sally gives mcqueen some gasoline sheriff notices mcqueen smiling at the road as if he is planning to escape in reply sheriff with a glare turns on his gumball in case lightning chooses to accompany sally rather than making an escape attempt resulting in sheriff switching off his emergency lighting this suggests the beginning of trust in lightning by sheriff he later befriends lightning mcqueen offering him a police escort to california and even giving a few sniffles when he thought lightning had left after finishing fixing the road though he denied it claiming he was glad lightning was gone and joins his pit crew for the championship race sheriff reappears in cars 2  seeing lightning and his race crew off to the world grand prix when mater goes missing flo mentions that sheriff has scotland yard scouring london for mater during the climax of the film sheriff arrives along with the other radiator springs resident as new members of mcqueens pit crew in england and is informed by mater of the lemons cars plot to kill mcqueen in order to turn all vehicles in the world against alternate energy and rely on gasoline for profit sheriff then has red the firetruck squirt water on the lemon cars during the final battle arrests most of the defeated ones with help from sarge then the next day sheriff cheers mater on when he is knighted for foiling the evil plot led by surprisingly the race and allinol inventor sir miles axlerod sheriff also partakes in the final melee against the lemon cars luigi voiced by tony shalhoub  is a 1959 fiat 500  he is a scuderia ferrari fan and has followed racing his entire life his license plate reads 445-108 which is the latitude and longitude for the main ferrari factory in maranello  italy  luigi owns a tire shop casa della tires which is known for its leaning tower of tires a tower of several tires shaped like the leaning tower of pisa  his assistant is an italian forklift truck named guido  inside his shop are many framed pictures of world sportscar championship endurance racing ferraris from various points in history at first luigi and guido do not respect lightning mcqueen when he comes to radiator springs owing to the substantial havoc that he inflicted upon the town when he first arrived because he is not a ferrari luigi follow only the ferraris but later on they learn to show courtesy to mcqueen fitting him with whitewall tires  since luigi is a fan of white tires having a pair himself during the final race luigi and guido work as part of lightnings pit crew and guido sets the piston cup record in changing tires taking only 4 seconds to change all the tires sending the other pit crew into shock after the race a group of italian sports cars – a ferrari f430 voiced by michael schumacher  and two maserati quattroportes – arrive at his shop explaining that lightning mcqueen told me this was the best place in the world to get tires and requesting three or four sets each the presence of a celebrity ferrari in their store causes both luigi and guido to faint from shock and happiness for the italian version of the film luigi was voiced by comedian marco della noce one of della noces most popular characters was oriano ferrari a parody character meant to represent the leader of ferraris pit stop crew  in cars 2  luigi is a part of lightnings pit crew in charge of the racers tires in japan he is naturally overjoyed to see so many ferraris at a party prior to the first race of the world grand prix he also hesitantly begins to explain to mater what a rendezvous is but he and guido do not believe mater when he believes he has a date guido dont believe you guido still dont believe you luigi and guido are overjoyed to be back in their home of italy and rejoin their large group of family and friends a little more is discussed of luigis past with guido luigis uncle topolino mentions that luigi and guido often fought when they worked for him over things like which ferrari was the best and which one of them looked more like a ferrari etc but they always made up after their fights luigi joins his friends in a mêlée against professor zündapps lemons at the films climax and finally believes maters claims of a girlfriend when holley shiftwell confirms the fact in person at radiator springs he is seen driving at the end of finding nemo  guido voiced by guido quaroni  is an early 1950s isetta forklift  who works at luigis casa della tires and is luigis best friend the only language guido can speak and understand fluently is italian though he appears to understand english and even speaks a few phrases including pit stop but pronounced peet stop his dream is to perform a pit stop for a real racecar near the end of the movie as a member of lightnings new pit crew he performs the fastest pit stop in piston cup history speed-changing all four tires in only 4 seconds shocking chick hicks pit crew who had earlier made fun of him and causing their moustachesgrills to fall off in the process in order to preserve the language barrier gags between guido and the other characters in the italian dub his lines and the other cars lines in italian have been rendered with the emiliano-romagnolo accent spoken in the town of modena  italy home of the ferrari car manufacturer and racing team alex zanardi  an italian race driver who is a native of bologna the largest city in the emilia-romagna region and thus presumably familiar with that dialect voiced guido for the italian version coincidentally or as a pun by the authors the name guido is a perfect homonym for the italian inflected verb meaning i drive  in cars 2  guido serves the same purpose he served in the first films climax in lightnings pit crew throughout the film he also removed all tires from some of the lemons when the malicious cars surrounded lightning and mater but is unable to remove the bomb from maters nose engine guido dryly does not believe mater when he says he has a date non ci credo but has a literally jaw-dropping moment when he sees that mater was telling the truth about his new girlfriend holley shiftwell guido believe you now - luigi ramone voiced by

enjoying the smoothness of the road in a deleted scene that told the story of how ramone and flo fell in love the only customer ramone has refused to paint was his future wife flo when she asked him whassamatta you too good to paint me? he promptly and smoothly replies no way you too good for me to paint and saying that he could not touch a classic like flo which made her heart melt the story

 high barnet tube station is a london underground station located in high barnet in north london  the station is the terminus of the high barnet branch of the northern line and is in travelcard zone 5  it is the northernmost station on the northern line and is situated 102 miles 164 km north north-west of charing cross  the next station south is totteridge  whetstone  northern line trains are scheduled to arrive and depart every 3–9 minutes from the stations three southbound platforms with trains operating to morden via bank or to kennington or morden via charing cross  in the early hours of the morning between about 0000 and 0100 departing trains run as far as east finchley only from where journeys to central london can be continued by night bus n20  which also serves high barnet station itself when trains are no longer required to run on the northern line they may be stabled on the sidings to the east of the station high barnet station was planned by the edgware highgate and london railway ehlr and was originally opened on 1 april 1872 by the great northern railway which had taken over the ehlr  on the original site of the barnet faire it was the terminus of the branch of a line that ran from finsbury park to edgware via highgate  after the 1921 railways act created the big four railway companies the line was from 1923 part of the london  north eastern railway lner the section of the high barnet branch north of east finchley was incorporated into the london underground network through the  northern heights  project begun in the late 1930s high barnet station was first served by northern line trains on 14 april 1940  and after a period where the station was served by both operators lner services ended in 1941  the station still retains much of its original victorian architectural character today a considerable number of platform buildings dating from the pre-lt era in the autumn 2008 a new train crew accommodation block began construction immediately to the south west of the station in part of the stations car park also further improvements have been introduced a new covered step-free entrance from the car park to platform one is now available along with a ramp at the end of the platform connecting it to platforms two and three there are also two accessible toilets now available these works were fully completed in october 2009 therefore there is full step-free access coverage in the station although a considerably steep path to the station still exists if approaching from the north and a steep approach from the road to station level from the south also remains many buses serve roads near high barnet station but access between the bus stops and the station is not ideal involving fairly long walks and road crossings this is due to the position of high barnet station in the surrounding steep geography of barnet hill buses serving roads near the station are from meadway stop p northbound - at the top of the steep pedestrian path leading north from the station entrance and turn right from barnet hill stop n southbound - at the top of the steep pedestrian path leading north from the station entrance and cross meadway from barnet hill stop r southbound - turn left outside station entrance and follow pedestrian path adjacent to car park bus stop is located at the junction between this path and barnet hill from barnet hill stop q northbound - turn left outside station entrance and follow pedestrian path adjacent to car park turn right at the junction with barnet hill cross at the pelican crossing turn right up barnet hill and across milton avenue to bus stop alternatively walk to the top of the steep pedestrian path leading north from the station entrance cross barnet hill and turn left down barnet hill allow at least five minutes to reach this stop either way london transport museum photographic archive high barnet station in 1935 during the lner period prior to london transports take-over old station building just to the south of the modern entrance platform 3 looking north roundel on the platform
a minimum wage is the lowest hourly daily or monthly remuneration that employers may legally pay to workers equivalently it is the lowest wage at which workers may sell their labour although minimum wage laws are in effect in many jurisdictions differences of opinion exist about the benefits and drawbacks of a minimum wage supporters of the minimum wage say it increases the standard of living of workers reduces poverty reduces inequality boosts morale and forces businesses to be more efficient  while opponents of the minimum wage say it increases poverty increases unemployment particularly among low productivity workers and is damaging to businesses    statutory minimum wage regulation was first introduced in new zealand in 1894 and the australian colony of victoria in 1896  some attempt to control wages had been present since trade unions were progressively decriminalised during the nineteenth century through collective agreement  however this meant that a uniform minimum wage was not possible in principles of political economy in 1848 john stuart mill argued that because of the collective action problems that workers faced in organisation it was a justified departure from laissez faire policies or freedom of contract  to regulate peoples wages and hours by law however it was not until the turn of the twentieth century that the first attempts to do this were seen the movement for a minimum wage was initially targeted at stopping sweatshop labour first enacted in new zealand in 1894  there is now legislation or binding collective bargaining regarding minimum wage in more than 90 of all countries  minimum wage rates vary greatly across many different jurisdictions not only in setting a particular amount of money eg us 925 per hour under certain states law or 213 for employees who receive tips known as the tipped minimum wage  919 in the us state of washington and scheduled to rise to 932 in 2014   and £ 631 for those aged 21 in the united kingdom   but also in terms of which pay period eg russia and china set monthly minimums or the scope of coverage some jurisdictions allow employers to count tips given to their workers as credit towards the minimum wage level india is one of the first developing countries to introduce minimum wage policy it is also one of the most complicated systems with more than 1200 minimum wage rates  sometimes a minimum wage exists without a law custom and extra-legal pressures from governments or labour unions can produce a de facto minimum wage so can international public opinion by pressuring multinational companies to pay third world workers wages usually found in more industrialised countries the latter situation in southeast asia and latin america was publicised in the 2000s but it existed with companies in west africa in the middle of the twentieth century  blanket minimum wage levels for all industries could also be set as a fixed percentage of the gdp per capita or the income tax threshold of the nation  among the indicators that might be used to establish an initial minimum wage rate are ones that minimize the loss of jobs while preserving international competitiveness  among these are general economic conditions as measured by real and nominal gross domestic product inflation labor supply and demand wage levels distribution and differentials employment terms productivity growth labor costs business operating costs the number and trend of bankruptcies economic freedom rankings standards of living and the prevailing average wage rate in the business sector concerns include the expected increased cost of doing business threats to profitability rising levels of unemployment and subsequent higher government expenditure on welfare benefits raising tax rates and the possible knock-on effects to the wages of more experienced workers who might already be earning the new statutory minimum wage or slightly more  among workers and their representatives political consideration weigh in as labor leaders seek to win support by demanding the highest possible rate  other concerns include purchasing power inflation indexing and standardized working hours in the united states the minimum wage promulgated by the fair labor standards act of 1938 was intentionally set at a high national level to render low-technology low-wage factories in the south obsolete  to adjust for increased rates of worker productivity in the united states raising the minimum wage to 22 or more an hour has been proposed     an analysis of supply and demand of the type shown in introductory mainstream economics textbooks implies that by mandating a price floor above the equilibrium wage minimum wage laws should cause unemployment    this is because a greater number of people are willing to work at the higher wage while a smaller numbers of jobs will be available at the higher wage companies can be more selective in those whom they employ thus the least skilled and least experienced will typically be excluded an imposition or increase of a minimum wage will generally only affect employment in the low-skill labor market as the equilibrium wage is already at or below the minimum wage whereas in higher skill labor markets the equilibrium wage is too high for a change in minimum wage to affect employment  according to the model shown in nearly all introductory textbooks on economics increasing the minimum wage decreases the employment of minimum-wage workers  one such textbook says if a higher minimum wage increases the wage rates of unskilled workers above the level that would be established by market forces the quantity of unskilled workers employed will fall the minimum wage will price the services of the least productive and therefore lowest-wage workers out of the market …the direct results of minimum wage legislation are clearly mixed some workers most likely those whose previous wages were closest to the minimum will enjoy higher wages this is known as the ripple effect the ripple effect shows that when you increase the minimum wage the wages of all others will consequently increase due the need for relativity  others particularly those with the lowest prelegislation wage rates will be unable to find work they will be pushed into the ranks of the unemployed or out of the labor force some argue that by increasing the federal minimum wage however the economy will be adversely affected due to small businesses not being able to keep up with the need to subsequently increase all workers wages   it illustrates the point with a supply and demand diagram similar to the one below it is assumed that workers are willing to labor for more hours if paid a higher wage economists graph this relationship with the wage on the vertical axis and the quantity hours of labor supplied on the horizontal axis since higher wages increase the quantity supplied the supply of labor curve is upward sloping and is shown as a line moving up and to the right  a firms cost is a function of the wage rate it is assumed that the higher the wage the fewer hours an employer will demand of an employee this is because as the wage rate rises it becomes more expensive for firms to hire workers and so firms hire fewer workers or hire them for fewer hours the demand of labor curve is therefore shown as a line moving down and to the right  combining the demand and supply curves for labor allows us to examine the effect of the minimum wage we will start by assuming that the supply and demand curves for labor will not change as a result of raising the minimum wage this assumption has been questioned  if no minimum wage is in place workers and employers will continue to adjust the quantity of labor supplied according to price until the quantity of labor demanded is equal to the quantity of labor supplied reaching equilibrium price  where the supply and demand curves intersect minimum wage behaves as a classical price floor on labor standard theory says that if set above the equilibrium price more labor will be willing to be provided by workers than will be demanded by employers creating a surplus of labor ie  unemployment  in other words the simplest and most basic economics says this about commodities like labor and wheat for example artificially raising the price of the commodity tends to cause the supply of it to increase and the demand for it to lessen the result is a surplus of the commodity when there is a wheat surplus the government buys it since the government doesnt hire surplus labor the labor surplus takes the form of unemployment which tends to be higher with minimum wage laws than without them  so the basic theory says that raising the minimum wage helps workers whose wages are raised and hurts people who are not hired or lose their jobs because companies cut back on employment but proponents of the minimum wage hold that the situation is much more complicated than the basic theory can account for one complicating factor is possible monopsony in the labor market whereby the individual employer has some market power in determining wages paid thus it is at least theoretically possible that the minimum wage may boost employment though single employer market power is unlikely to exist in most labor markets in the sense of the traditional  company town  asymmetric information imperfect mobility and the personal element of the labor transaction give some degree of wage-setting power to most firms  the argument that minimum wages decrease employment is based on a simple supply and demand model of the labor market a number of economists for example pierangelo garegnani  robert l vienneau  and arrigo opocher  ian steedman   building on the work of piero sraffa  argue that that model even given all its assumptions is logically incoherent michael anyadike-danes and wyne godley  argue based on simulation results that little of the empirical work done with the textbook model constitutes a potentially falsifying test and consequently empirical evidence hardly exists for that model graham white  argues partially on the basis of sraffianism that the policy of increased labor market flexibility including the reduction of minimum wages does not have an intellectually coherent argument in economic theory gary fields professor of labor economics and economics at cornell university  argues that the standard textbook model for the minimum wage is ambiguous and that the standard theoretical arguments incorrectly measure only a one-sector market fields says a two-sector market where the self-employed service workers and farm workers are typically excluded
from minimum-wage coverage and with one sector with minimum-wage coverage and the other without it and possible mobility between the two is the basis for better analysis through this model fields shows the typical theoretical argument to be ambiguous and says the predictions derived from the textbook model definitely do not carry over to the two-sector case therefore since a non-covered sector exists nearly everywhere the predictions of the textbook model simply cannot be relied on  an alternate view of the labor market has low-wage labor markets characterized as monopsonistic competition wherein buyers employers have significantly more market power than do sellers workers this monopsony could be a result of intentional collusion between employers or naturalistic factors such as segmented markets search costs information costs imperfect mobility and the personal element of labor markets  in such a case the diagram above would not yield the quantity of labor clearing and the wage rate this is because while the upward sloping aggregate labor supply would remain unchanged instead of using the downward labor demand curve shown in the diagram above monopsonistic employers would use a steeper downward sloping curve corresponding to marginal expenditures to yield the intersection with the supply curve resulting in a wage rate lower than would be the case under competition also the amount of labor sold would also be lower than the competitive optimal allocation such a case is a type of market failure and results in workers being paid less than their marginal value under the monopsonistic assumption an appropriately set minimum wage could increase both wages and employment  with the optimal level being equal to the marginal product of labour   this view emphasizes the role of minimum wages as a market regulation policy akin to antitrust policies as opposed to an illusory  free lunch  for low-wage workers another reason minimum wage may not affect employment in certain industries is that the demand for the product the employees produce is highly inelastic  for example if management is forced to increase wages management can pass on the increase in wage to consumers in the form of higher prices since demand for the product is highly inelastic consumers continue to buy the product at the higher price and so the manager is not forced to lay off workers economist paul krugman argues this explanation neglects to explain why the firm was not charging this higher price absent the minimum wage  three other possible reasons minimum wages do not affect employment were suggested by alan blinder  higher wages may reduce turnover  and hence training costs raising the minimum wage may render moot the potential problem of recruiting workers at a higher wage than current workers and minimum wage workers might represent such a small proportion of a businesss cost that the increase is too small to matter he admits that he does not know if these are correct but argues that the list demonstrates that one can accept the new empirical findings and still be a card-carrying economist  economists disagree as to the measurable impact of minimum wages in the real world this disagreement usually takes the form of competing empirical tests of the elasticities of demand and supply in labor markets and the degree to which markets differ from the efficiency that models of perfect competition predict economists have done empirical studies on numerous aspects of the minimum wage prominently including  until the mid-1990s a strong consensus existed among economists both conservative and liberal that the minimum wage reduced employment especially among younger and low-skill workers  in addition to the basic supply-demand intuition there were a number of empirical studies that supported this view for example gramlich 1976 found that many of the benefits went to higher income families and in particular that teenagers were made worse off by the unemployment associated with the minimum wage  brown et al 1983 note that time series studies to that point had found that for a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage there was a decrease in teenage employment of 1–3 percent however for the effect on the teenage unemployment rate the studies exhibited wider variation in their estimates from zero to over 3 percent in contrast to the simple supplydemand figure above it was commonly found that teenagers withdrew from the labor force in response to the minimum wage which produced the possibility of equal reductions in the supply as well as the demand for labor at a higher minimum wage and hence no impact on the unemployment rate using a variety of specifications of the employment and unemployment equations using ordinary least squares vs generalized least squares regression procedures and linear vs logarithmic specifications they found that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage caused a 1 percent decrease in teenage employment and no change in the teenage unemployment rate the study also found a small but statistically significant increase in unemployment for adults aged 20–24  wellington 1991 updated brown et als research with data through 1986 to provide new estimates encompassing a period when the real ie inflation-adjusted value of the minimum wage was declining because it had not increased since 1981 she found that a 10 increase in the minimum wage decreased the absolute teenage employment by 06 with no effect on the teen or young adult unemployment rates  some research suggests that the unemployment effects of small minimum wage increases are dominated by other factors  in florida where voters approved an increase in 2004 a follow-up comprehensive study confirms a strong economy with increased employment above previous years in florida and better than in the us as a whole  when it comes to on-the-job training some believe the increase in wages is taken out of training expenses a 2001 empirical study found that there is no evidence that minimum wages reduce training and little evidence that they tend to increase training  some empirical studies have tried to ascertain the benefits of a minimum wage beyond employment effects in an analysis of census data dr joseph j sabia and dr robert p nielson found no statistically significant evidence that minimum wage increases helped reduce financial housing health or food insecurity  this study was undertaken by the employment policy institute a think tank funded by the food beverage and hospitality industries  in 2012 michael reich published an economic analysis that suggested that a proposed minimum wage hike in san diego might stimulate the citys economy by about 190 million  the economist wrote in december 2013 a minimum wage providing it is not set too high could thus boost pay with no ill effects on jobsamericas federal minimum wage at 38 of median income is one of the rich worlds lowest some studies find no harm to employment from federal of state minimum wages others see a small one but none finds any serious damage  in 1992 the minimum wage in new jersey increased from 425 to 505 per hour an 188 increase while the adjacent state of pennsylvania remained at 425 david card and alan krueger gathered information on fast food restaurants in new jersey and eastern pennsylvania in an attempt to see what effect this increase had on employment within new jersey basic economic theory would have implied that relative employment should have decreased in new jersey card and krueger surveyed employers before the april 1992 new jersey increase and again in november–december 1992 asking managers for data on the full-time equivalent staff level of their restaurants both times  based on data from the employers responses the authors concluded that the increase in the minimum wage increased employment in the new jersey restaurants  one possible explanation for why the current minimum wage laws may not affect unemployment in the united states is that the minimum wage is set close to the equilibrium point for low and unskilled workers thus according to this explanation in the absence of the minimum wage law unskilled workers would be paid approximately the same amount and an increase above this equilibrium point could likely bring about increased unemployment for the low and unskilled workers  card and krueger expanded on this initial article in their 1995 book myth and measurement the new economics of the minimum wage   they argued that the negative employment effects of minimum wage laws are minimal if not non-existent for example they look at the 1992 increase in new jerseys minimum wage the 1988 rise in californias minimum wage and the 1990–91 increases in the federal minimum wage in addition to their own findings they reanalyzed earlier studies with updated data generally finding that the older results of a negative employment effect did not hold up in the larger datasets  in subsequent research david neumark and william wascher attempted to verify card and kruegers results by using administrative payroll records from a sample of large fast food restaurant chains in order to verify employment they found that the minimum wage increases were followed by decreases in employment on the other hand an assessment of data collected and analyzed by neumark and wascher did not initially contradict the cardkrueger results  but in a later edited version they found a four percent decrease in employment and reported that the estimated disemployment effects in the payroll data are often statistically significant at the 5- or 10- percent level although there are some estimators and subsamples that yield insignificant—although almost always negative employment effects   a 2000 paper has reconciled the difference between card and kruegers survey data and neumark and waschers payroll-based data the paper shows that both datasets evidence conditional employment effects that are positive for small restaurants but are negative for large fast-food restaurants  in 1996 and 1997 the federal minimum wage was increased from 425 to 515 thereby increasing the minimum wage by 090 in pa but by just 010 in nj this allowed for an examination of the effects of minimum wage increases in the same area subsequent to the 1992 change studied by card and krueger a study by hoffman and trace found the result anticipated by traditional theory a detrimental effect on employment  further application of the methodology used by card and krueger by other researchers yielded results similar to their original findings across additional data sets  a 2010 study by three economists arindrajit dube of the university of massachusetts amherst t william lester of the university of north carolina at chapel hill and michael reich of the university of california berkeley compared adjacent counties in different states where the minimum wage had been raised in one of the states they analyzed employment trends for several categories of low-wage workers from 1990 to 2006 and found that increases in minimum wages had no negative effects on low-wage employment and successfully increased the income of workers in food services and retail employment as well as the narrower category of workers in restaurants   however a 2011 study by baskaya and rubinstein of brown university found that at the federal level a rise in minimum wage have  sic  an instantaneous impact on wage rates and a corresponding negative impact on employment stating minimum wage increases boost teenage wage rates and reduce teenage employment  another 2011 study by sen rybczynski and van de waal found that a 10 increase in the minimum wage is significantly correlated with a 3-5 drop in teen employment  a 2012 study by sabia hansen and burkhauser found that minimum wage increases can have substantial adverse labor demand effects for low-skilled individuals with the largest effects on those aged 16 to 24  a 2013 study by meer and west concluded that the minimum wage reduces net job growth primarily through its effect on job creation by expanding establishments  most pronounced for younger workers and in industries with a higher proportion of low-wage workers   a 2013 study by suzana laporšek of the university of primorska on youth unemployment in europe reached a similar conclusion finding a negative statistically significant impact of minimum wage on youth employment  a 2013 study by labor economists tony fang and carl lin which studied minimum wages and employment in china found that minimum wage changes have significant adverse effects on employment in the eastern and central regions of china and result in disemployment for females young adults and low-skilled workers  several researchers have conducted statistical meta-analyses of the employment effects of the minimum wage in 1995 card and krueger analyzed 14 earlier time-series studies on minimum wages and concluded that there was clear evidence of publication bias in favor of studies that found a statistically significant negative employment effect they point out that later studies which had more data and lower standard errors did not show the expected increase in t-statistic almost all the studies had a t-statistic of about two just above the level of statistical significance at the 05 level  though a serious methodological indictment opponents of the minimum wage largely ignored this issue as thomas c leonard noted the silence is fairly deafening  in 2005 td stanley showed that card and kruegers results could signify either publication bias or the absence of a minimum wage effect however using a different methodology stanley concludes that there is evidence of publication bias and that correction of this bias shows no relationship between the minimum wage and unemployment  in 2008 hristos doucouliagos and td stanley conducted a similar meta-analysis of 64 us studies on dis-employment effects and concluded that card and kruegers initial claim of publication bias is still correct moreover they concluded once this publication selection is corrected little or no evidence of a negative association between minimum wages and employment remains  consistent with the results from doucouliagos and stanley and card and krueger baskaya and rubinsteins 2011 study which analyzed 24 papers on the minimum wage found mild positive yet statistically insignificant association between the change in the employment of teenagers at state minimum wage levels however when minimum wage is set at the federal level they found notable wage impacts and large corresponding disemployment effects  minimum wage laws have usually been judged against the criterion of reducing poverty  minimum wage laws affect workers in most low-paid fields of employment  minimum wages receive less support from economists than from the general public despite decades of experience and economic research debates about the costs and benefits of minimum wages continue today  various groups have great ideological political financial and emotional investments in issues surrounding  minimum wage laws for example agencies that administer the laws have a vested interest in showing that their laws do not create unemployment as do labour unions whose members jobs are protected by minimum wage laws on the other side of the issue low-wage employers such as restaurants finance the employment policies institute which has released numerous studies opposing the minimum wage   the presence of these powerful groups and factors means that the debate on the issue is not always based on dispassionate analysis additionally it is extraordinarily difficult to separate the effects of minimum wage from all the other variables that affect employment  the following table summarizes the arguments made by those for and against minimum wage laws supporters of the minimum wage claim it has these effects opponents of the minimum wage claim it has these effects a widely circulated argument that the minimum wage was ineffective at reducing poverty was provided by george stigler in 1949 in 2006 the international labour organization ilo  argued that the minimum wage could not be directly linked to unemployment in countries that have suffered job losses in april 2010 the organisation for economic co-operation and development oecd  released a report arguing that countries could alleviate teen unemployment by lowering the cost of employing low-skilled youth through a sub-minimum training wage  a study of us states showed that businesses annual and average payrolls grow faster and employment grew at a faster rate in states with a minimum wage  the study showed a correlation but did not claim to prove causation although strongly opposed by both the business community and the conservative party when introduced in 1999 the minimum wage introduced in the uk is no longer controversial and the conservatives reversed their opposition in 2000  accounts differ as to the effects of the effects the centre for economic performance found no discernible impact on employment levels from the wage increases  while the low pay commission found that employers had reduced their rate of hiring and employee hours employed and found ways to cause current workers to be more productive especially service companies  the institute for the study of labor found prices in the minimum wage sector rose significantly faster than prices in non-minimum wage sectors in the four years following the implementation of the minimum wage  neither trade unions nor employer organizations contest the minimum wage although the latter had especially done so heavily until 1999 supporters of minimum wage in the business journal bloomberg businessweek point out that the country of denmark has a minimum pay rate of the equivalent of about 20 an hour but its business climate is sufficiently healthy for the world bank to ranked it as the easiest place in europe to do business in 2011 2012 and 2013 denmark is also among the leading countries in income equality and national happiness  denmark also had a lower unemployment rate 68 and higher labor participation rate 644 than the united states 74 636 as of september 2013 where the minimum wage is far lower 725  according to a 1978 article in the american economic review  90 of the economists surveyed agreed that the minimum wage increases unemployment among low-skilled workers  by 1992 the survey found 79 of economists in agreement with that statement  and by 2000 the percentage was 456 in full agreement with the statement and 279 agreeing with provisos 735 total   the authors of the 2000 study also reweighted data from a 1990 sample to show that at that time 624 of academic economists agreed with the statement above while 195 agreed with provisos and 175 disagreed they state that the reduction on consensus on this question is likely due to the card and krueger research and subsequent debate  a similar survey in 2006 by robert whaples polled phd members of the american economic association whaples found that 468 respondents wanted the minimum wage eliminated 377 supported an increase 143 wanted it kept at the current level and 13 wanted it decreased  another survey in 2007 conducted by the university of new hampshire survey center found that 73 of labor economists surveyed in the united states believed 150 of the then-current minimum wage would result in employment losses and 68 believed a mandated minimum wage would cause an increase in hiring of workers with greater skills 31 felt that no hiring changes would result  surveys of labor economists have found a sharp split on the minimum wage fuchs et al 1998 polled labor economists at the top 40 research universities in the united states on a variety of questions in the summer of 1996 their 65 respondents were nearly evenly divided when asked if the minimum wage should be increased they argued that the different policy views were not related to views on whether raising the minimum wage would reduce teen employment the median economist said there would be a reduction of 1 but on value differences such as income redistribution  daniel b klein and stewart dompe conclude on the basis of previous surveys the average level of support for the minimum wage is somewhat higher among labor economists than among aea members  in 2007 klein and dompe conducted a non-anonymous survey of supporters of the minimum wage who had signed the raise the minimum wage statement published by the economic policy institute  95 of the 605 signatories responded they found that a majority signed on the grounds that it transferred income from employers to workers or equalized bargaining power between them in the labor market in addition a majority considered disemployment to be a moderate potential drawback to the increase they supported  in 2013 a diverse group of economics experts was surveyed on their view of the minimum wages impact on employment 34 of respondents agreed with the statement raising the federal minimum wage to 9 per hour would make it noticeably harder for low-skilled workers to find employment 32 disagreed and the remaining respondents were uncertain or had no opinion on the question 49 agreed with the statement the distortionary costs of raising the federal minimum wage to 9 per hour and indexing it to inflation are sufficiently small compared with the benefits to low-skilled workers who can find employment that this would be a desirable policy while 11 disagree  economists and other political commentators  who?  have proposed alternatives to the minimum wage they argue that these alternatives may address the issue of poverty better than a minimum wage as it would benefit a broader population of low wage earners not cause any unemployment and distribute the costs widely rather than concentrating it on employers of low wage workers  a basic income or negative income tax  is a system of social security  that periodically provides each citizen with a sum of money that is sufficient to live on except for citizenship a basic income is entirely unconditional there is no means test and the richest as well as the poorest citizens would receive it a basic income is often proposed in the form of a citizens dividend a transfer payment from the government proponents argue that a basic income that is based on a broad tax base would be more economically efficient as the minimum wage effectively imposes a high marginal tax on employers causing losses in efficiency   in 1968 james tobin  paul samuelson  john kenneth galbraith and another 1200 economists signed a document calling for the us congress to introduce in that year a system of income guarantees and supplements  both tobin and samuelson have also come out against the minimum wage  in the 1972 presidential campaign senator george mcgovern called for a demogrant that was very similar to a basic income  winners of the nobel prize in economics that fully support a basic income include herbert a simon   friedrich hayek   robert solow   milton friedman   jan tinbergen   james tobin    and james meade   a guaranteed minimum income is another proposed system of social welfare provision  it is similar to a basic income or negative income tax system except that it is normally conditional and subject to a means test some proposals also stipulate a willingness to participate in the labor market  or a willingness to perform community services   a refundable tax credit is a mechanism whereby the tax system can reduce the tax owed by a household to below zero and result in a net payment to the taxpayer beyond their own payments into the tax system examples of refundable tax credits include the earned income tax credit and the additional child tax credit in the us and working tax credits and child tax credits in the uk such a system is slightly different from a negative income tax  in that the refundable tax credit is usually only paid to households that have earned at least some income in the united states earned income tax credit rates also known as eitc or eic vary by state—some are refundable while other states do not allow a refundable tax credit  the federal eitc program has been expanded by a number of presidents including jimmy carter ronald reagan george hw bush and bill clinton  in 1986 president reagan described the eitc as the best anti poverty the best pro-family the best job creation measure to come out of congress  the ability of the earned income tax credit to deliver larger monetary benefits to poor workers than an increase in the minimum wage

excalibur pot is a natural cave in the north yorkshire moors area of england it is the only major cave known in the north york moors  and is formed within the corallian limestone of the upper jurassic  the entrance is in the normally dry stream bed of hutton beck midway between hutton-le-hole and keldholme two short pitches of 8 m and 5 m descend to a large chamber which is followed by an extensive inlet series and a large main streamway accessed by a 4 m pitch several areas have admirable formations far more elaborate than anything else found on the north york moors the sources of the water are various sinks in hutton beck and the stream eventually resurges from bogg hall rising in the adjacent douthwaite dale at keldholme
meritaten tasherit  which means meritaten the younger was an ancient egyptian princess of the 18th dynasty  she is likely to have been the daughter of meritaten  eldest daughter of pharaoh akhenaten  the father of this child remains under debate many assume it to be none other than meritatens father akhenaten or possibly her husband smenkhkare  since both meritaten tasherit and another princess ankhesenpaaten tasherit appear only in texts that once mentioned akhenatens second wife kiya  it is also possible that they were children of akhenaten and kiya or that they were fictional replacing the name of kiyas daughter who might have been beketaten  more commonly thought to be tiye s child   the fate of this child is uncertain  the mention of the god aten in her name suggests that she was indeed a daughter of akhenaten since his successors reverted his religious reforms and reverted to the worship of egypt s traditional gods meanwhile the name aten was dropped from popular use during this time

in a post-apocalyptic future all electricity on earth has been disabled within a single night ranging from computers and electronics to car and jet engines  trains and cars stopped where they were ships went dead in the water and fly-by-wire aircraft fell from the sky and crashed people were forced to adapt to a world without electricity over the next fifteen years due to the collapse of government and public order many areas are now ruled by warlords and militias it starts with the surviving matheson family ben charlie and danny now living near what used to be chicago who possessed a pendant-shaped device a usb flash drive contained in a pendant that is the key to not only finding out what happened fifteen years ago but also a possible way to reverse its effects however sebastian monroe the general of the monroe militia and self-appointed president of the monroe republic  an area of the former united states east of the mississippi river northward of kentucky and the carolinas now possesses that power for himself seeking conquest of the entire former united states of america the remaining matheson family joined initially by miles matheson aaron pittman and nora clayton now strive to counter the monroe militia monroes new benefactor randall flynn a former us assistant secretary of defense who 15 years earlier ordered the deployment of the weaponized technology that caused the blackout now seeks to fortify monroe in his efforts after rachel escaped from his custody  in season 1 episode 5 soul train a map of north america is shown  the map showed the former continental united states canada  and mexico divided into six parts the monroe republic in the northeast maritime provinces and great lakes region the georgia federation in the southeast the plains nation in the northern midwest and rocky mountain states texas which controls portions of mexico oklahoma arkansas and louisiana the california commonwealth which has the pacific coast from baja california to british columbia  and the wasteland in the vicinity of arizona new mexico utah and mexico  the same episode also indicates that the georgia federation and plains nation have allied against the monroe republic border skirmishing in southwest illinois near st louis is mentioned according to the wife of captain thomas neville julia in a letter to her husband the monroe republic capital of philadelphia pennsylvania is relatively safe however life outside west of pittsburgh is subject to rebel attacks and other dangers such as bandits  in april 2013 the series was renewed for

heusinger and jessie collins were also signed  supernatural alumnus jim beaver was cast as john franklin fry a hard-ass whip smart texas ranger who allies with miles  the second season takes place six months after the events of the first season at the start of the series united states of america has been split into at least six nations led by president and commanding general sebastian monroe the monroe republic appears to be a military dictatorship covering what used to be the northeastern section of the united states  it has annexed some of southeastern canada including parts of quebec  and all of new brunswick and nova scotia  the capital of the monroe republic was philadelphia  with independence hall serving as the capitol building the city is destroyed by a nuclear missile in season two the western border is the mississippi river from west of lake superior to the ohio river  the southern border appears to be the ohio river continuing to the western border of west virginia  running south to the southern border of virginia  then diagonally possibly following the roanoke river  to albemarle sound in north carolina  the eastern border is the atlantic ocean from albemarle sound to nova scotia new brunswick and the gulf of st lawrence  the northern border appears to coincide with the northern border of the former united states from duluth through the great lakes  but then follows a more northerly line along the st lawrence river to the atlantic the rebels are a faction fighting against the monroe militia they profess to be fighting to restore the united states of america they began working with the georgia federation which supplies the rebels with more weapons and troops given the destruction of both philadelphia and atlanta and monroes absence the state of the rebels is unknown the georgia federation georgia was a prosperous nation led by president kelly foster covering the former southeastern united states the capital of the georgia federation was atlanta  georgia had a tense relationship with the monroe republic that devolved into war the northern border appears to be the ohio river continuing to the western border of west virginia running south to the southern border of virginia then diagonally possibly following the roanoke river to albemarle sound in north carolina the eastern and southern borders are the atlantic and gulf of mexico shore from albemarle sound to part way through louisiana  the western border is the mississippi river from the ohio river south to approximately baton rouge  then due south to the gulf of mexico the atomic bombing of atlanta by randall flynn sparked a massive refugee crisis with at least one camp being set up in savannah georgia  texas has had tension with the monroe republic for at least part of the time after the blackout but assuming they would lose the monroe republic did not want to go to war with them the eastern border of texas is the mississippi river from the arkansas river south to approximately the atchafalaya river  then due south to the gulf of mexico the extent south is unclear from the maps shown in the show it extends further south than the map does but it extends well into former mexico  the western border coincides with the western border of the us state of texas north of the rio grande  but extends diagonally west from about midway between el paso  juárez and big bend to the gulf of california  rangers have become a sort of military police force in the country in season two a war clan from the plains nation enters texan territory the plains nation is dominated by several individual tribes who dictate their own laws the people in the plains nation live in tribes similar to those of the native americans  eventually all of the main characters travel into the plains nation to get to a dod facility in colorado springs known as the tower  the southern part of the canadian province of manitoba has been annexed by the plains nation little is known about the california commonwealth other than the head-of-state is known as governor affleck monroe was set to send jason neville with an emissary to california before major neville talked him out of sending his son it is unknown if the emissary was sent or what relationship the monroe republic has with california california takes up all of the land of the states of baja california sur  baja california  california  oregon  and washington  as well as parts of nevada and idaho  the northern border is unclear as it extends past the edge of the map but it appears to extend into british columbia  the wasteland is not mentioned in the show only shown on the map it appears to take up parts of mexico utah nevada and idaho  as well as all of new mexico and arizona  it mostly bordered the california commonwealth in the westand the plains nation in the eastand texas in the southwest the patriots are a mysterious group who claim to be the former members of the united states government in the season one finale it is revealed that randall flynn has been working for the patriots a group that supposedly includes the last president of the united states and the remnants of the last us government who have been sheltering at the us naval station at guantanamo bay cuba  in season two they are reclaiming us soil after an absence of seventeen years and are hiring bounty hunters who are gathering warlords whether they represent a true continuation of the us government has been questioned by major neville their official documents are marked with a symbol resembling the eye of providence  they are brutal dangerous violent cruel selfish abusive and dictatorial and they are responsible for the nuclear attacks on atlanta and philadelphia when they sent randall flynn on the mission to the tower they also have a secret agenda in mind president foster of the georgia federation stated that her nation received aid from england  the fate of most other world nations is not specifically mentioned but miles mentions that the georgia federation made its trade with the european nations and some other foreign nations the world was also seen on the satellite view at the tower as the worlds cities are possibly abandoned or not  it is therefore implied that other nations continue to exist in some form mexico apparently is one of the richest nations as mentioned in episode 10 of second season and they have a large tall concrete wall to keep texans and californians out of their wealthy nation miles has to pretend to be a tomato pick-up guy to enter to the mexican republic that seems to be intact  apparently the blackout affected mexico less severely because it relies less on technology and has rich agricultural resources so they become wealthier than most us states sebastian monroe jokes about the ¨mexican dream¨ when they steal a wagon going into mexico  despite its wealth a series-sponsored map shows much of northern mexico occupied by the american nations the same map provided by the series suggests that the post-american nations have not invaded or occupied the canadian provinces of prince edward island ontario alberta and saskatchewan as they have with all or parts of the other provinces  however it is not indicated if these surviving provinces continue to function as political entities nor whether canada still has a central government in ottawa or any other location executive producer jj abrams told the los angeles times  hero complex blog that series creator eric kripke came to us with an idea that was undeniably good it was such a great premise for a series that it was just that feeling of the misery that you’d feel if you had a chance to be part of that and didn’t take advantage of it i’m really looking forward to that show he’s so obviously the real deal and we’re just really lucky and honored that he wanted to collaborate with us on it  the series - described by its creators as a romantic swashbuckling sci-fi adventure  - debuted in the united states on september 17 2012  in october 2012 nbc announced it would pick up the series for an additional nine episodes after achieving an average of 98 million viewers for the first three episodes  after november 26 2012 revolution went on hiatus for a holiday break and to catch up on post-production following this the show resumed broadcast on march 25 2013 for the remaining episodes of season 1  the role of rachel matheson was originally played by andrea roth until she was replaced by elizabeth mitchell   a portion of episode 4 of season 1 was filmed at freestyle music park in myrtle beach south carolina    eric kripke says i definitely like to know where it’s going i know what season 1 is i have a really solid idea about what season 2 is and i’m starting to think about notions for season 3 knock on wood revolution was renewed for a full 22 episode second season in april 2013  production for season two has moved to austin  texas    in canada

glen garvin of the miami herald described the show as big bold and brassy adventure a cowboys-and-indians story for end times  dorothy rabinowitz of the wall street journal praised the production quality of the pilot if the quality of this one so irresistible in its vitality and suspense does fail to hold up its creators will have delivered at the least one remarkably fine hour  ed bark observed that the show has the overall look and feel of a big budget feature delivers some consistently terrific action scenes  some have compared the show to dies the fire  the hunger games and lost

the manila folder occasionally oak tag  is a file folder designed to contain documents   it is generally formed by folding a large sheet of stiff card in half though traditionally buff  sometimes other colors are used to differentiate categories of files the manila envelope is an envelope designed for transporting documents it is made of thick durable paper and sized so that full sheets of paper can fit inside without being folded as with the manila folder it is traditionally buff  and often has a mechanism on the closing flap that allows it to be opened without damaging the envelope so that the envelope can be re-used there are two main methods to achieve this—the first incorporates a metal clasp of two prongs which are put through a reinforced eyelet in the flap and then bent apart to hold the other has a cardboard button secured tightly on the flap and a piece of string fastened on the envelope body is wound around it to form a closure in a more general sense envelopes made of brown unbleached paper used for cheapness are described as manila envelopes the manila component of the name comes from manila hemp or abacá  from which manila folders were originally made manila envelope dimensions as accepted by us postal service are
a fantasy sports stock simulation is a type of fantasy sport game it differs from standard fantasy sports games  which involve drafting teams and competing against other teams in a league in certain statistical categories in a fantasy sports stock simulation players and teams are stocks in a stock market which can be bought and sold and which acquire earnings based on their statistics while standard fantasy sports games typically require drafting a team at the beginning of a season to participate fantasy players can join and participate in a fantasy sports stock market at any time during the season fantasy stock simulations are similar to prediction games and prediction markets in that players speculate on the future of stock prices in a virtual world the format was largely developed by wall street sports in the 1990s with the game growing to 75000 members by 1998  wall street sports was later sold to sandboxcom which grew to an audience of 35 million players  however sandboxcom went bankrupt in 2002 and the game ceased operations and the domain name was sold to an off-shore betting site  contemporary examples of fantasy sports stock simulations include earnlikeaprocom athletexchange kickertape starstreet and investorball

 an atmospheric railway uses air pressure to provide power for propulsion in one plan a pneumatic tube is laid between the rails with a piston running in it suspended from the train through a sealable slot in the top of the tube alternatively the whole tunnel may be the pneumatic tube with the car being the piston with a seal to the walls by means of stationary pumping engines along the route air is exhausted from the tube leaving a partial vacuum in advance of the piston or car and air is admitted to the tube behind the piston or car so that atmospheric pressure propels the train in some plans air pressure is applied behind the pistoncar  a number of systems were built in the early to mid 19th century but none lasted long  new designs have been developed since the 1970s with one in operation on a few sites in 1799 george medhurst of london discussed the idea of moving goods pneumatically through cast iron pipes and in 1812 he proposed but never implemented blowing passenger carriages through a tunnel  in 1835 henry pinkus launched a prospectus for the national pneumatic railway association it was in 1838 when the gas engineer samuel clegg and the marine engineers jacob and joseph samuda jointly took out a patent “for a new improvement in valves” that atmospheric propulsion became possible  the partnership set up a working model at the samuda brothers’ workshop in southwark in 1839 and a 05-mile 08 km demonstration track of the birmingham bristol  thames junction railway at wormwood scrubs between 1840 and 1843 in 1841 joseph daguilar samuda published a treatise on the adaptation of atmospheric pressure to the purposes of locomotion on railways   the clegg-samuda system attracted the attention and support of some of the foremost railway engineers of the day notably william cubitt  charles vignoles and isambard kingdom brunel  each of whom was engaged on the construction of new railway lines it was also severely criticised by other engineers and railway commentators notably robert stephenson and john herapath  the first practical use of the system was on the dublin and kingstown railway s dalkey atmospheric railway between kingstown  dún laoghaire  and dalkey  ireland  this 175-mile 282 km line was built by vignoles and operated between 1844 and 1854  cubitt recommended the system for the 75-mile 121 km london and croydon railway between london bridge station and croydon  clegg and samuda were invited by the directors to supply equipment to operate their trains between london bridge and epsom   the first stage of this project between croydon and forest hill  opened in january 1846 but many problems both with the pumping equipment and in maintaining air-tight seals in the delivery pipes were encountered the london and croydon railway became a part of the london brighton and south coast railway in july 1846 and the new board of directors invited samuda to operate the new atmospheric railway on their behalf in return for a fixed fee once further propulsion problems became apparent in the second section of line to be equipped between forest hill and new cross  during 1847 the atmospheric method of propulsion was abandoned and the equipment sold one part of the pneumatic infrastructure was the viaduct from sydenham to crystal palace crossing the main lines the pneumatic pipe could not cross the metals so it was necessary to build a fly-over this is reputed to be the first of its kind and is still in use today the extension of brunels broad gauge railway westward from exeter towards plymouth by the south devon railway company sdr involved one of his most interesting uses of technical innovation brunel and others from the gwr travelled to ireland to view the atmospheric system at dalkey first hand afterwards brunels engineer of locomotives for the gwr daniel gooch  calculated that conventional locomotives could work the proposed plymouth line at lower cost but brunels concerns with the heavy grades led him to try the atmospheric system regardless   the 20-mile 32 km section from exeter to newton now newton abbot  was completed on the principle with stationary engines at around 3 mi 5 km intervals trains ran at speeds of up to 70 miles per hour 113 kmh but service speeds were usually around 40 mph 64 kmh  the level portions used 15-inch 38 cm pipes and the steeper gradients west of newton were to have used 22 in 56 cm pipes it is not clear how the change between the two pipe sizes would have been achieved unless the piston carriages were changed at newton it is also unclear how the level crossing at turf was operated as the pipe projected above the rails the harsh environment of the line which runs next to the sea and is soaked with salt spray in even moderate winds presented difficulties in maintaining the leather flaps provided to seal the vacuum pipes which had to be kept supple by being greased with tallow  even so air leaked in destroying the vacuum unfortunately the tallow made the greased leather attractive to rats  whose depredations further reduced the efficiency of the seal  atmospheric-powered service lasted less than a year from 1847 experimental services began in september operationally from 23 february 1848  to 9 september 1848 the accounts of the sdr for 1848 suggest that the atmospheric traction cost 3s 1d per mile £010km compared to 1s 4d £004km for conventional steam power part of the problem was that the engines had to be run for longer than expected as they were not initially connected to the telegraph and so had to pump according to the railway timetable until the train passed which increased pumping costs despite the building of several engine houses the system never expanded beyond newton the proposal to use the same system on the cornwall railway was not pursued there are remains of several south devon railway engine houses  including one at starcross   on the estuary of the river exe  it is a striking landmark and a reminder of the atmospheric railway commemorated by the name of the village pub  the atmospheric railway a section of the pipe without the leather covers is preserved in didcot railway centre and at the newton abbot town and gwr museum in newton abbot devon the aeromovel corporation of brazil markets an automated people mover that is air driven lightweight trains ride on rails mounted on an elevated hollow concrete box girder that forms the air duct  each car is attached to a square plate within the duct by a mast running through a longitudinal slit that is sealed with rubber flaps stationary electric blowers are located along the line to either blow air into the duct to create pressure or to exhaust air from the duct to create suction as in other systems the pressure differential acting on the plate causes the vehicle to move  electric power for lighting and braking is supplied to the train by a low voltage 50v being applied to the track this is used to charge onboard batteries  the trains have conventional brakes for accurate stopping at stations these brakes are automatically applied if there is no pressure differential acting on the plate  fully loaded vehicles have a ratio of payload to dead-weight of about 11 which is up to three times better than conventional alternatives   the vehicles are driverless with motion determined by lineside controls  aeromovel was designed in the late 1970s by brazilian oskar coester   flight rail corp is developing a high-speed atmospheric train that uses vacuumair pressure to move passenger modules along an elevated guideway stationary power systems create vacuumpressure inside a continuous pneumatic tube power tube located centrally below rails within a truss assembly as these power systems pull the air from the power tube they create a vacuum in front of a free piston that is guided by rails inside the power tube the free piston is magnetically coupled to the passenger modules above additionally air enters the tube behind the free piston to create differential pressure the magnetic coupling allows the interior of the power tube to be a closed system to maintain the desired pressure differential in the tube the transportation unit operates above the power tube on a pair of parallel steel rails that receive support and guide the wheels of the truck assemblies the company currently has a 16 scale pilot model operating on an outdoor test guideway the guideway is 1385 feet 422 m long and incorporates 2 6 and 10 grades the pilot model operates at speeds up to 25 mph 4025 kmh atmostrack was awarded a patent  in 2006 for a system that uses vacuum and pressure supply tubes running besides the drive tubes these are interconnected by a series of valves  the opening and closing of the valves provides the pressure differential on a piston in the drive tube  their website does not list contact details as at august 2013 the supporters of the atmospheric system claimed it had several advantages over traditional motive power by steam locomotive  the failure of the 19th century systems was due to technical problems with the stationary engines and the leather seals on the vacuum pipes the former were suffered by the london and croydon railway but would have been overcome with more experience by the manufacturers and operators the difficulty of maintaining an air-tight seal in the vacuum pipes was a serious problem particularly for the south devon railway company  which was never satisfactorily solved using the materials and technology of the 1840s the atmospheric system also suffered from a number of operating problems the atmospheric system foresaw the inherent efficiencies of delivering centrally generated power to the line side rather than generating it on individual locomotives as would ultimately become the normal practice with electrification systems  the use of modern materials and technology would overcome many of the problems of the original systems but atmospheric railways were ultimately too inflexible for widespread use  the durability of the jakarta installation and the construction of the first commercial point-to-point people mover in 2013 indicates that there may be a niche where the advantages of the system makes it a preferred option to other solutions

a cable modem is a type of network bridge and modem that provides bi-directional data communication via radio frequency channels on a hybrid fibre-coaxial hfc and rfog infrastructure cable modems are primarily used to deliver broadband internet access in the form of cable internet  taking advantage of the high bandwidth of a hfc and rfog network they are commonly deployed in australia  europe  asia and the americas  internet experiment note ien 96  1979 describes an early rf cable modem system  from pages 2 and 3 of ien 96 the mitrewashington cablenet system is based on a technology developed at mitrebedford similar cable-bus systems are in operation at a number of government sites eg walter reed army hospital  and the nasa johnson space center  but these are all standalone local-only networks the system uses standard community antenna television catv coaxial cable and microprocessor based bus interface units bius to connect subscriber computers and terminals to the cable  the cable bus consists of two parallel coaxial cables one inbound and the other outbound the inbound cable and outbound cable are connected at one end the headend  and electrically terminated at their other ends this architecture takes advantage of the well developed unidirectional catv components   the topology is dendritic ie branched like a tree   the ieee 802 committee defined 10broad36 in 8023b-1985  as a 10 mbps ieee 8023  ethernet broadband system to run up to 3600 metres 11800 ft over catv coax network cabling  the word broadband as used in the original ieee 8023 specifications implied operation in frequency-division multiplexed  fdm  channel bands as opposed to digital baseband square-waveform modulations also known as line coding  which begin near zero hz and theoretically consume infinite frequency bandwidth   in real-world systems higher-order signal components become indistinguishable from background noise   in the market 10broad36 equipment was not developed by many vendors nor deployed in many user networks as compared to equipment for ieee 8023 ethernet baseband standards such as 10base5 1983 10base2 1985 10base-t 1990 etc the ieee 802 committee also specified a broadband catv digital networking standard in 1989 with 8027-1989   however like 10broad36  8027-1989 saw little commercial success hybrid networks developed demonstrated and patented the first high-speed asymmetrical cable modem system in 1990 a key hybrid networks insight was that in the nascent days of the internet data downloading constitutes the majority of the data traffic and this can be served adequately with a highly asymmetrical data network ie a large downstream data pipe and many small upstream data pipes  this allowed catv operators to offer high speed data services immediately without first requiring an expensive system upgrade  also key was that it saw that the upstream and downstream communications could be on the same or different communications media using different protocols working in each direction to establish a closed loop communications system the speeds and protocols used in each direction would be very different the earliest systems used the public switched telephone network pstn for the return path since very few cable systems were bi-directional later systems used catv for the upstream as well as the downstream path hybrids system architecture is used for most cable modem systems today lancity was an early pioneer in cable modems developing a proprietary system that was widely deployed in the us lancity which was led by the iranian-american engineer rouzbeh yassini  was then acquired by nortel  which eventually spun the cable modem business off as arris  arris continues to make cable modems and cmts equipment compliant with the docsis standard zenith offered a cable modem technology using its own protocol which it introduced in 1993 being one of the first cable modem providers the zenith cable modem technology was used by several cable television systems in the united states and other countries including cox communications san diego ameritech s americast service later to be sold off to wide open west after the sbc  ameritech merger and cogeco in hamilton ontario  zenith homeworks used bpsk bi-phase shift keyed modulation to achieve 500 kbitsec in 600 khz or 4 mbitsec in 6 mhz  com21 was another early pioneer in cable modems and quite successful until proprietary systems were made obsolete by the docsis standardization the com21 system used a comcontroller as central bridge in catv network head-ends the comport cable modem in various models and the nmaps management system using hp openview as platform later they also introduced a return path multiplexer to overcome noise problems when combining return path signals from multiple areas the proprietary protocol was based on asynchronous transfer mode atm the central comcontroller switch was a modular system offering one downstream channel transmitter and one management module the remaining slots could be used for upstream receivers 2 per card dual ethernet 10baset and later also fast-ethernet and atm interfaces the atm interface became the most popular as it supported the increasing bandwidth demands and also supported vlans 
com21 developed a docsis modem but the company filed for bankruptcy in 2003 and closed the docsis cmts assets of com21 were acquired by arris  cdlp was a proprietary system manufactured by motorola  cdlp customer premises equipment cpe was capable of both pstn telephone network and radio frequency cable network return paths the pstn-based service was considered one-way cable and had many of the same drawbacks as satellite internet service as a result it quickly gave way to two-way cable cable modems that used the rf cable network for the return path were considered two-way cable and were better able to compete with the bi-directional digital subscriber line dsl service the standard is in little use now while new providers use and existing providers having changed to the docsis standard the motorola cdlp proprietary cybersurfr is an example of a device that was built to the cdlp standard capable of a peak 10 mbits downstream and 1532 mbits upstream cdlp supported a maximum downstream bandwidth of 30 mbits which could be reached by using several cable modems the australian isp bigpond employed this system when it started cable modem tests in 1996 for a number of years cable internet access was only available in sydney  melbourne and brisbane via cdlp this network ran parallel to the newer docsis system for several years in 2004 the cdlp network was terminated and replaced by docsis cdlp has been also rolled out at the french cable operator numericable before upgrading its ip broadband network using docsis digital video broadcasting  dvb  and digital audio visual council davic are european-formed organizations that developed some cable modem standards  however these standards have not been as widely adopted as docsis in the mid-1990s the ieee 802 committee formed a subcommittee 80214  to develop a standard for cable modem systems  ieee 80214 developed a draft standard which was atm-based   however the 80214 working group was disbanded when north american multi system operators  msos  instead backed the then-fledgling docsis 10 specification which generally used best efforts service and was ip-based with extension codepoints to support atm  for qos in the future msos were interested in quickly deploying service to compete for broadband internet access customers instead of waiting on the slower iterative and deliberative processes of standards development committees  albert a azzam was secretary of the ieee 80214 working group  and his book high-speed cable modems   describes many of the proposals submitted to 80214 although the internet engineering task force ietf generally does not generate complete cable modem standards the ietf chartered working groups  wgs  that produced various standards related to cable modem technologies including 80214 docsis packetcable  and others  in particular the ietf wgs on ip over cable data network ipcdn  and ip over digital video broadcasting dvb  produced some standards applicable to cable modem systems primarily in the areas of simple network management protocol snmp management information bases  mibs  for cable modems and other networking equipment that operates over catv networks  in the late 1990s a consortium of us cable operators  known as mcns formed to quickly develop an open and interoperable cable modem specification the group essentially combined technologies from the two dominant proprietary systems at the time taking the physical layer from the motorola cdlp system and the mac layer from the lancity system when the initial specification had been drafted the mcns consortium handed over control of it to cablelabs which maintained the specification promoted it in various standards organizations notably scte and itu  developed a certification testing program for cable modem equipment and has since drafted multiple extensions to the original specification while deployed docsis rfi 10 equipment generally only supports best efforts service  the docsis rfi 10 interim-01 document discussed qos extensions and mechanisms using intserv  rsvp  rtp  and synchronous transfer mode stm telephony as opposed to atm   docsis rfi 11  later added more robust and standardized qos mechanisms to docsis docsis 20 added support for s-cdma phy  while docsis 30 added ipv6 support and channel bonding to allow a single cable modem to use concurrently more than one upstream channel and more than one downstream channel in parallel virtually all cable modems operating in the field today are compliant with one of the docsis versions because of the differences in the european pal and usas ntsc systems two main versions of docsis exist docsis and eurodocsis the main differences are found in the width of rf-channels 6 mhz for the usa and 8 mhz for europe a third variant of docsis was developed in japan and has seen limited deployment in that country although interoperability was the whole point of the docsis project  most cable operators only approve a very restricted list of cable modems on their network   identifying the allowed modems by their brand models sometimes firmware version and occasionally going as far as imposing a hardware version of the modem instead of simply allowing a supported docsis version as it should from this point of view the docsis standard has failed to provide the promised practical interoperability for the end user with the advent of voice over internet protocol voip telephony cable modems have been extended to provide telephone service some companies which offer cable tv service also offer voip phone allowing customers who purchase cable tv to eliminate their plain old telephone service pots because many telephone companies do not offer naked dsl dsl service without pots line service voip use is higher amongst cable modem users  any high-speed internet service subscriber can use voip telephony by subscribing to a third-party service eg skype  the problem is that doing so one needs to turn on their computer to use the telephone while cable modems have a port to connect the phone directly without using a computer however there are also stand-alone voip systems available that connect directly to a broadband router eg vonage  magicjack and nettalk  many cable operators offer their own voip service based on packetcable  packetcable allows multiple system operators msos to offer both high-speed internet and voip through the same cable transmission system  packetcable service has a significant technical advantage over third-party providers in that voice packets are given guaranteed quality of service across their entire transmission path so call quality can be assured when using cable operator voip a combined customer premises equipment device known as an embedded multimedia terminal adapter e-mta will often be used  an e-mta is a cable modem and a voip adapter mta multimedia terminal adapter  bundled into a single device in network topology a cable modem is a network bridge that conforms to ieee 8021d for ethernet networking with some modifications the cable modem bridges ethernet frames between a customer lan and the coax network technically it is a modem because it must modulate data to transmit it over the cable network and it must demodulate data from the cable network to receive it with respect to the osi model of network design a cable modem is both physical layer layer 1 device and a data link layer layer 2 forwarder as an ip addressable network node cable modems support functionality at other layers layer 1 is implemented in the ethernet phy on its lan interface  and a docsis defined cable-specific phy on its hfc cable interface the term cable modem refers to this cable-specific phy the network layer layer 3 is implemented as an ip host in that it has its own ip address used by the network operator to maintain the device in the transport layer layer 4 the cable modem supports udp in association with its own ip address and it supports filtering based on tcp and udp port numbers to for example block forwarding of netbios traffic out of the customers lan in the application layer layer 7 the cable modem supports certain protocols that are used for management and maintenance notably dynamic host configuration protocol dhcp snmp and tftp  some cable modems may incorporate a router and a dhcp server to provide the lan with ip network addressing from a data forwarding and network topology perspective this router functionality is typically kept distinct from the cable modem functionality at least logically even though the two may share a single enclosure and appear as one unit sometimes called a residential gateway  so the cable modem function will have its own ip address and mac address as will the router cable modems can have a problem known in industry jargon as flap or flapping a modem flap is when the connection by the modem to the head-end has been dropped gone offline and then comes back online the time offline or rate of flap is not typically recorded only the incidence while this is a common occurrence and usually unnoticed if a modems flap is extremely high these disconnects can cause service to be disrupted if there are usability problems due to flap the typical cause is a defective modem or very high amounts of traffic on the service providers network upstream utilization too high  types of flap include reinsertions hits and misses and power adjustments

the election assistance commission  eac  is an independent agency of the united states government created by the help america vote act of 2002 hava  the commission serves as a national clearinghouse and resource of information regarding election administration it is charged with administering payments to states and developing guidance to meet hava requirements adopting voluntary voting system guidelines and accrediting voting system test laboratories and certifying voting equipment  it is also charged with developing and maintaining a national mail voter registration form the eac is tasked with performing a number of election-related duties including  the hava dictates the eac will create voluntary guidelines for voting systems maintaining a clearinghouse of information regarding election administration procedures including testing and certification of election equipment and administering the election assistance and help america vote programs  in 2003 congress appropriated us15 billion for hava the general services administration distributed most of the 650 million permitted under title i of hava but the remainder was earmarked for the eac to disburse the funds languished because the commissioners were not confirmed until 9 december 2003 the law had required that they be in place by 26 february 2003  in its 2004 budget congress again allocated 15 billion to fund hava  by january 2004 the eac had no permanent offices or budget even though it was required to publish state election reform plans in the federal register before money for new voting equipment could be disbursed to the states  in 2011 united states representative gregg harper introduced a bill to end the eac and transfer some of its authority to the federal election commission   the help

in the 1980s the fbi began a program called the “ library awareness program ”
this program was designed as a counterintelligence effort that would provide information to the fbi including the names and reading habits of users of many different libraries  the fbi was particularly interested in learning this type of information about foreign diplomats or their agents  it is clear that librarians and the public were unaware of this program until its existence was made public in an article published september 18 1987 in the new york times  the fbi claimed that one of the major reasons this program was initiated was because hostile intelligence agents had been able to find some information that could be dangerous to the security of the united states   the area of greatest concern was the information at academic libraries that could be accessed through sophisticated databanks used for research this point was illuminated by the report that a soviet employee of the united nations had been able to recruit a college student from queens to obtain information at the library that was described as sensitive the libraries in new york city that had been the subjects of the fbi visits contacted the new york library association about what had happened they in turn contacted the american library association  this led to the opposition of the program by the nyla a long time new york congressman and the ala 
this resulted in widespread outrage within the field  in october 1987 the ala’s intellectual freedom committee released a statement that explained the threat of this program and urged libraries not to violate their ethical obligation to protect patron’s rights by providing information to the fbi  in 1988 congressional hearings were conducted on the subject the purpose of these hearings may have been to find out what the fbi had been up to in regards to the library awareness program and if it was lawful following these hearings several foia requests were submitted to obtain more information on the subject eventually the fbi complied with one of the requests and released 37 pages of information about fbi activities related to the program through this release it was learned that the actual program name may have been development of counterintelligence among librarians  or decal  after the congressional hearings in 1988 many institutions decided to adopt formal policies about what to do in the event that the fbi contacted the library most libraries have policies in case of such an event today librarians have tried to make it clear that they were not against helping the fbi in general but rather that they opposed violating the rights of their patrons since that time many librarians have helped the fbi in a variety of projects that did not encroach on the patron’s rights the issue has gathered a renewed concern since “ 9-11 ” and the “ patriot act ” some people believe that the patriot act grants the government the right to inspect patron records without due cause in much the same way as the library awareness program foerstel herbert n surveillance in the stacks the fbis library awareness program  new york greenwood press 1991 isbn 978-0-313-26715-4 mcfadden robert d fbi in new york asks librarians aid in reporting on spies new york times   september 18 1987 sec a p 1

the mt type carriages were railmotor trailers used on the railways of victoria  australia  when the vr built their aec railmotors they quickly realised that extra capacity was needed to this end they built the railmotor trailers or mt class specifically designed for the aec railcars when later railmotors were introduced this pattern was followed and so the mt class was one of the more varied classes of vr rollingstock it was not uncommon to see a train composed of one railmotor and two three or in rare cases four trailers these were numbered 1 through 24 they were painted red and were the only mt cars that were four-wheelers they were built between 1922 and 1925 these were numbered 26 through 30 they were painted red to start although a different red to the aec trailers when the perms were converted to derm diesel railmotors in the mid-1950s the five trailers were painted in blue and gold trailer cars 50 - 64 were walkers railcar trailers placed in service between 1948 and 1954 they were primarily placed behind the 102hp and 153hp variations but occasionally were coupled to 280hp versions of note is that walker trailers 50 and 51 were originally classed rmt instead of mt they were reclassed to the norm by 1949 number 25 was a conversion of a standard carriage apl 20  in 1928 trailers car 31 was converted from 65abw in about 1981  while cars 32 to 34 were converted from vfw cars 3 4 and 6 in 1981 cars 31 to 34 were painted in vr blue and gold and only ran for about 2–3 years numbers 40 - 42 were trailers used behind motor cars converted for rail use numbers 35-39 43-49 and 65-100 were not used opinions  by whom?  vary on whether or not the four mth cars count as railmotor trailers they were originally harris suburban trains but when these were taken out of service a large number were refurbished for use on intrastate trains as part of this four were converted to mth cars for use behind the four drc railcars  when the drcs were taken out of service the four mths were transferred to the stony point line  where they were run behind an a class diesel locomotive their last revenue-run was on saturday 26 april 2008 now no-one is sure of their fate although they are currently in storage

  frankfurt main east station  german  bahnhof frankfurt main ost or frankfurt ostbahnhof  serves regional rail services in the ostend district of frankfurt  germany  its container terminal is one of the two remaining freight yards in the city the other is industriepark höchst  after the much larger frankfurt central freight yard  hauptgüterbahnhof  was closed the freight yard of frankfurts eastern river port also lies to the east until the opening of the east station trains coming from hanau finished their journeys at a terminal station between the streets of röderbergweg zobelstraße and hanauer landstraße south of the zoo  it was opened on 10 september 1848 by the frankfurt-hanau railway as hanau station  hanauer bahnhof  the line and station were taken over by the hessian ludwig railway in 1872 which was taken over by prussian state railways in 1897 todays  east station was officially opened by the prussian state railways on 10 march 1913 freight operations however began only on 1 april and passenger services in may 1913 the original station building of 1914 with its huge hall was burnt in world war ii and 60 destroyed a temporary station was opened to serve its 10000 daily commuters and freight trains in 1961 a sober purpose-built station in the style of the 1960s was built using the corridors and basements of the old buildings  its design by karl radlbeck ignored the grand design of the previous station and replaced it with a rectangular building with a large boxy roof adorned only with an illuminated db sign and a clock both of which are no longer attached to the building this building has now become dilapidated  on 29 may 1999 the station on u-bahn line u6 was opened this is a short branch from zoo station off the ostend branch of u-bahn line c which is operated as line u7 the underground station is in partly under danziger platz and partly under the main line station south of the station building the axis of the u-bahn station crosses the main line station a long-planned extension would pass under the frankfurt-hanau line and run east of it along hanauer landstraße
originally the station platform was only 75 metres long instead of the normal 105 metres in the frankfurt u-bahn allowing the operation of trains with a maximum of three carriages in 2001 construction began for the extension of the platforms to 105 metres which was completed on 26 april 2007 allowing the unrestricted use of four-car trains at the same time a new pedestrian link was built and a new ostbahnhofhonsellstrasse station was opened for trams and buses the importance of the station for passengers has been greatly reduced as most trains to the east use the route over the south main route via offenbach  regional trains to and from hanau and regional express trains between würzburg and frankfurt stop at frankfurt east until the early 1990s it was an important station for the united states armed forces  in particular military trains to berlin operated from here the us rolling stock was parked in the station sidings when not in traffic after the closure of the central frankfurt freight yard the frankfurt east station became the centre of freight handling in frankfurt the freight yard was expanded from about 2003 to house a container terminal a large area to the east of the east station which had previously been used for the frankfurt main east railway workshop was redeveloped as a storage space for containers and transport vehicles along with arrival and departure routes to the road network complete freight trains are run from east station yard mainly for the automotive and mining industries until 1993 frankfurt east station was served directly by tram line 11  as a result of the rebuilding of danziger platzes the tram stop was moved into the adjacent hanauer landstrasse originally with the intention of it returning a rebuilt stop at its former location in the station forecourt after the completion of construction works for cost reasons and because the current stop is closer to the future home of the european central bank on the grounds of the former großmarkthalle  the city council decided in 2002 to leave the tram stop permanently in its current situation
since 1999 east station has been connected to the u-bahn network  in the next few years the north main s-bahn is expected to be built from frankfurt east station to hanau next to the current frankfurt–hanau line until a decision is made on the commencement of construction of the s-bahn line the current run-down condition of the station is likely to continue

securities regulation in the united states is the field of us law that covers various aspects of transactions and other dealings with securities   the term is usually understood to include both federal- and state-level regulation by purely governmental regulatory agencies but sometimes may also encompass listing requirements of exchanges like the new york stock exchange and rules of self-regulatory organizations like the securities investor protection corporation sipc and the financial industry regulatory authority finra  on the federal level the primary securities regulator is the securities and exchange commission sec however futures and some aspects of derivatives are regulated by the federal commodity futures trading commission cftc finra is a self-regulatory organization that promulgates rules that govern brokers and dealers and certain other kinds of professionals in the securities industry  it was formed by the merger of the enforcement divisions of the national association of securities dealers nasd and the new york stock exchange  finra like the exchanges and the sipc is overseen by the sec and finras rules are generally subject to sec approval all brokers and dealers that are registered with the sec pursuant to 15 usc § 78o  with a number of exceptions are required to be members of sipo pursuant to 15 usc § 78ccc  another self-regulatory organization and are subject to its regulations the sipc like the exchanges and finra is overseen by the sec and the sipcs rules are generally subject to sec approval the federal securities laws were largely created as part of the new deal  there are 5 particularly prominent federal securities laws since these laws were originally enacted congress has amended them many times  the holding company act and the trust indenture act in particular have changed significantly since then  the titles listed above including the year of original enactment are the so-called popular names of these laws and practitioners in this area reference these statutes using these popular names eg section 10b of the exchange act or section 5 of the securities act  when they do so they do not generally mean the original provisions of the original acts they mean as amended to date when congress amends the securities laws those amendments have their own popular names a few prominent examples include securities investor protection act of 1970  the insider trading sanctions act of 1984 the insider trading and securities fraud enforcement act of 1988 and the dodd-frank act   these acts often include provisions that state that they are amending one of the primary 5 laws  other laws passed since then include private securities litigation reform act 1995 sarbanes–oxley act 2002 jumpstart our business startups act 2012 and various other federal securities laws  although practitioners in this area use these popular names to reference the federal securities laws like all us statutes they are generally all codified in the us code which is the official codification of us statutory law  they are contained in title 15  thus the official code citation for section 5 of the securities act of 1933 is actually 15 usc section 77e  not every law adopted by congress is codified because some of them just arent appropriate for codification  eg appropriations are not codified there are also fairly extensive regulations under these laws largely made by the sec  one of the most famous and often used sec rules is rule 10b-5 which prohibits fraud in securities transactions as well as insider trading  because interpretations under rule 10b-5 often deem silence to be fraudulent in certain circumstances efforts to comply with rule 10b-5 and avoid lawsuits under 10b-5 have been responsible for a very large amount of corporate disclosure the federal securities laws govern not only the offer and sale of securities but also trading of securities activities of certain professionals in the industry investment companies like mutual funds tender offers proxy statements and generally the regulation of public companies  public company regulation is largely a disclosure-driven regime but it has grown in recent years to the point that it begins to dictate certain issues of corporate governance state laws governing issuance and trading of securities are commonly referred to as blue sky laws  before the wall street crash of 1929  there was little regulation of securities in the united states at the federal level  the crash spurred the congress to hold hearings known as the pecora commission   after ferdinand pecora  after holding hearings on the abuses congress passed the securities act of 1933   it regulates the interstate sales of securities and made it illegal to sell securities into a state without complying with that states laws  it requires companies which want to sell securities publicly to file a registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission  the registration statement provides a broad range of information about the company and is a matter of public record  the sec does not approve or disapprove the issue of securities  but rather permits the filing statement to become effective if sufficient required detail is provided including risk factors  the company can then begin selling the stock issue usually through investment bankers the following year congress passed the securities exchange act of 1934  which regulates the secondary market general-public trading of securities  initially the 1934 act applied only to stock exchanges and their listed companies as the word exchange in the acts name implies  in the late 1930s the act was amended to provide regulation of the over-the-counter otc market ie trades between individuals with no stock exchange involved  in 1964 the act was amended to apply to companies traded in the otc market after these acts courts interpreted the laws assembling a body of united states securities case law  in 1988 the supreme court of the united states decided basic inc v levinson  which allowed for class action lawsuits under sec rule 10b-5 and the fraud-on-the-market theory which resulted in an increase in securities class actions  the private securities litigation reform act and the state model law securities litigation uniform standards act was a response to class actions  in october 2000 the securities and exchange commission ratified regulation fair disclosure reg fd which required publicly traded companies to disclose material information to all investors at the same time  reg fd helped level the playing field for all investors by helping to reduce the problem of selective disclosure  in 2010 the dodd–frank wall street reform and consumer protection act was passed to reform securities law in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007–2008

the zodiarts  ゾディアーツ  zodiātsu   are the fictional antagonists in the kamen rider series kamen rider fourze   each of the zodiarts is named after one of the western constellations  and each zodiarts body is decorated with the pattern of the constellation it is named after the name zodiarts is derived from the english word  zodiac   ゾディアック  zodiakku   and is used to refer to both an individual and the collective group a zodiarts is a monstrous construct that is produced when a zodiarts switch  ゾディアーツスイッチ  zodiātsu suitchi   is activated by a person then on known as a switcher  スイッチャー  suitchā    from there a zodiarts switch gathers a mysterious energy from space called cosmic energy  コズミックエナジー  kozumikku enajī   that forms a monstrous construct around a human that can withstand transwarp travel these switches are provided by mituaki gamou to amanogawa high students as they appear to have the potential to evolve the zodiarts switches powers by their state of minds a zodiarts switch imprints on its switcher as once a switch is activated the only person who can use the switch is the switcher himself exceptions only occur to very few who has a special constitution allowing use of other zodiarts switches the only such exceptions revealed thus far are mituaki gamou and kou tatsugami a zodiarts switch can only be activated by a person with negative intentions and is impossible to be truly used for good according to tachibana one has a higher chance of finding a lost artificial satellite in the entire universe than finding a zodiarts switcher that truly uses his or her powers for good though given the fact that tachibanas true identity is that of professor kuniteru emoto who is himself the virgo zodiarts and he dedicates his life to undermine gamous plan for good causes the evil nature of the zodiarts switches is questionable  it is also stated that zodiarts switches take a physical toll on the user as a consequence of the forced evolution causing the longest-term users to dissolve into stardust after being defeated by a limit break rather than simply switching off  in some shorter-term cases the users powers can backfire on them after defeat if they were overused as in the case of the aries zodiart compatibility is another important and dangerous feature of the zodiarts switch as when a zodiarts switch is first activated by one who is incompatible with the switch it backfires on the switcher such in the case of jiro iseki who is rendered comatose after activating an incompatible switch conversely a zodiarts switch will reach the last one state when the user is overwhelmed by their negative emotions to the point that they no longer wish to be human with the switch announcing last one in the voice of the horoscopes who provided the switch a last one switch also changes its appearance growing spikes and an eyeball-like structure as well as changing the position of the button when the switcher activates the switch at this point the transformation becomes irreversible as the switch drains its switcher of their conscious mind and uses it to become a zodiarts permanently the switchers empty body is ejected from the zodiarts covered in a cobweb-like substance in this state the zodiarts becomes extremely powerful and can only be defeated if targeted at point of its body where the zodiarts switch is located in some cases the last one state doubles as a pupa state where certain zodiarts can evolve further into one of the horoscopes once the resurrection star begins to glow absorbing their original bodies to remain human should a person have latent exceptional compatibility with a horoscopes switch a regular zodiarts switch might evolve into a horoscopes switch the very first time it is activated allowing its switcher to skip the last one state altogether and instantly become a horoscopes-type zodiarts fighting a zodiarts in its last one state a kamen rider can use one of its limit break  リミットブレイク  rimitto bureiku   finishing attacks to destroy the monsters body and get the zodiarts switch once properly switched off the zodiarts switch will vanish into a singularity  returning the users mind to its body toshiya miura  三浦 俊也  miura toshiya   is a second-year student who is a member of the aghs football club who became tired of how the teams members particularly captain shun daimonji  treat him as a mere lowly servant and never let him have a chance on the field to get back at shun he is given a zodiarts switch that allows him to become the orion zodiarts  オリオン・ゾディアーツ  orion zodiātsu    a zodiarts with intense brute strength which is armed with a club called the  lemnos   レムノス  remunosu   and a shield called the  chios   キオス  kiosu    although he is initially defeated by the first appearance of kamen rider fourzes rider rocket drill kick the mysterious scorpion zodiarts returns the zodiarts switch to miura allowing him to use it once more to confront shun after tomoko nozama reveals the identity of the zodiarts to gentaro kisaragi and yuki jojima  they reach miura in time to persuade him not to go through with his plans however shun pushes miura over the edge by kicking him out of the football club driving him to use the zodiarts switch just as it enters its last one state as the monster has amassed enough energy to blow up the stadium kengo utahoshi directs kamen rider fourze to take the orion zodiarts into the upper atmosphere in order to destroy him with the rider rocket drill space kick allowing the zodiarts switch to be turned off so miuras mind can return to his body miura was hospitalized soon after from the ordeal miura later recovered from the ordeal but he refused to go back to school and ignored shuns many apologies for putting him through what had happened it was later revealed that it was not because he did not want to go back to school but he rather was avoiding returning to school grounds due to his new-found addiction to the cosmic energy of a zodiarts switch the horoscopes use this to their advantage by having sonoda present him with a new zodiarts switch which due to his emotional state immediately reaches its last one state as soon as he grabs hold of it however due to gentaro his girlfriend mari and the rest of the kamen rider club showing him his old self he is able to reject the zodiarts switch of his own free will afterwards he befriends gentaro and joins the photography club to be with mari toshiya miura is portrayed by masanori mizuno  水野 真典  mizuno masanori    mizuno previously portrayed jun watarifire-5 in tomica hero

tamae is given the zodiarts switch that allows her to become the chameleon zodiarts  カメレオン・ゾディアーツ  kamereon zodiātsu    a zodiarts that can appear invisible as well as attack with its powerful tongue-like tendrils to orchestrate her plan to remove miu from the contest tamae begins to attack students that could be potential threats to her success then when miu takes the stage for the talent competition tamae fakes being attacked herself so she would be able to transform and cause a commotion allowing for a video of miu lambasting the student body to play when her identity is revealed tamae fakes remorse to catch miu off guard and injures her severely to remove her from the contest however miu musters up enough strength to return to school despite her yet-to-recover injuries and wins back the hearts of the student body with her powerful speech tamae enraged that her plan has failed ignores kengos warning against using her zodiarts switch when it enters its last one state she attacks miu as the chameleon zodiarts once more but kamen rider fourze is able to save the schools reigning queen and eventually destroys the zodiarts with his rider rocket drill kick gaining access to the zodiarts switch to shut it off after miu wins the contest for the third year in a row she forgives tamae for her actions and renews their friendship under the promise that tamae would beat miu through honest means she is one of the students to constantly being absent from the school because of the cosmic energy of the zodiarts switches she returns in episode 25 wanting to ask gentaro to the prom she along with ritsuko and jin are accused to be the cause of all havoc wrecked in the school near graduation irritating them enough to skip their convocation altogether at gentaros annoying insistence she and jin end up going to the prom together instead tamae sakuma is portrayed by maria yoshikawa  吉川 まりあ  yoshikawa maria     fumihiro nitta  新田 文博  nitta fumihiro   is a first-year

unicorn zodiarts  ユニコーン・ゾディアーツ  yunikōn zodiātsu    while fighting kamen rider fourze nittas desire for revenge causes a sudden evolution in his zodiarts form where his horse-faced mask converts into the longsword monarch  長剣 モナーク  chōken monāku   rapier this new power combined with his ability to project horseshoe-shaped energy projectiles makes the unicorn zodiarts a force to be reckoned with in a fight after capturing jk nitta amusingly allows him a chance for freedom by contacting someone for help with full knowledge that no one in jks circle would save him however gentaro thought to be the last on the list whod actually come save jk proves nitta wrong by coming to save the guy who betrayed his trust gentaro manages to transform into kamen rider fourze elek states and destroys the zodiarts with the rider ten billion volt break though jk intends to beat the daylights out of nitta for slighting him gentaro stops him while reminding him that he is the one in the wrong in the first place while offering his friendship to nitta fumihiro nitta is portrayed by kiyotaka uji  宇治 清高  uji kiyotaka     teruhiko satake  佐竹 輝彦  satake teruhiko   is a first-year student who is the rebellious son of aghss takashi satake  though he is a student who scores good grades he is unhappy with his life and adopts delinquent hobbies and mannerisms at some point he receives a zodiarts switch from the scorpion zodiarts in order to transform into the hound zodiarts  ハウンド・ゾディアーツ  haundo zodiātsu   and uses his newly gained abilities to be himself and go on a rampage or hunting as he calls it attacking anyone and anything nearby when he feels like it he fights with his powerful claws and the chain that hangs around his neck the hound zodiarts can also fire a barrage of needle-like

normal zodiarts they undergo an evolution of their human selves keeping their human bodies unlike less advanced last one zodiarts they answer directly to mituaki gamou and serve as members of his inner circle sharing his ideals while believing themselves and those they select to be chosen by the universe to become superior beings this is relevant as gamou is among those who were reached by the presenters  プレゼンター  purezentā    a mysterious alien race that sends core switches to various worlds to enable the dominant race of that planet to reverse engineer a means to contact them in humanitys case their core switch became the basis for the fourze driver and the zodiarts switches possessing unique golden and crimson-colored zodiarts switches with each button engraved with its zodiarts forms respective astrological symbol  the horoscopes normally wear heavy robes which they discard should they need to fight at their full potential they can use their cosmic energies to conjure footsoldiers called stardust ninja dustards  星屑忍者ダスタード  hoshikuzu ninja dasutādo    each of which are armed with katana-like duswords  ダスソード  dasusōdo     they are also able to undergo a transformation called supernova  超新星  chōshinsei    some assuming an even more powerful form resembling an enormous version of their constellation with the normal zodiarts form embedded as a pilot of sorts somewhere on the giant form while others feature subtle changes with new powers the supernova powers can only be used for a limited period as overuse will result in the said zodiarts destruction the original four members posing as staff members in aghs seek to complete their intended twelve-member group by recruiting eight more from those among the aghs student body they select to use zodiarts switches whom they believe to have the mental status to awaken their resurrection star  最輝星  saikisei   and transcend the last one phase once all twelve horoscopes are gathered gamou will cause a mysterious event called the day of awakening  覚醒の日  kakusei no hi   where he uses the eleven additional switches and the atmospheric vortex above the school known as the hole  ザ・ホール  za hōru   would be converted into the dark nebula  ダークネビュラ  dāku nebyura    a dimensional labyrinth created from the negative cosmic energy produced from a zodiartss creation to allow him to reach the presenter but in the process the dark nebulas pull would destroy the entire city while all twelve horoscopes switches have been created and in his hands gamou is unable to enact the day of awakening due to kengos interference but even though he kills kengo to rectify it gamous scheme is ultimately foiled by the kamen rider club sarina sonoda  園田 紗里奈  sonoda sarina   is the youthful and beautiful homeroom teacher of class 2-b who teaches classical literature though she appears to be a teacher every student in the school loves she is actually a member of the horoscopes who uses her pleasant facade to know the students better in order to find ideal suitors for zodiarts switches she herself was originally an aghs student until she met hayami who gave her a zodiarts switch that enabled her to become the canis minor zodiarts  カニスミノル・ゾディアーツ  kanisu minoru zodiātsu     eventually after her zodiarts switch assumed its last one state and her resurrection star glowed ms sonoda discarded her humanity and evolved into the scorpion zodiarts  スコーピオン・ゾディアーツ  sukōpion zodiātsu    while in her scorpion zodiarts state ms sonodas voice deepens to sound masculine possibly to avoid suspicion regarding her identity out of gamous inner circle ms sonoda is the most loyal to his cause and serves as his right hand using the special scorpion switch to assume her zodiarts form the scorpion zodiarts uses a kick-based fighting style she is also armed with powerful claw gauntlets and a scorpions tail-like ponytail that doubles as a whip and can inject an agonizing venom into her victims the scorpion zodiarts initially works behind the scenes distributing the zodiarts switches to students that want to seek revenge against those who have slighted them the scorpion zodiarts later appears before kamen rider fourze during the events of the chameleon zodiartss vendetta against miu though originally ordered by gamou to not eliminate the kamen rider and instead fights him when his meddling becomes a hindrance but once she begins to give miura a new zodiarts switch ms sonoda is given full permission to kill kamen rider fourze during her plot to kill off gentarou gamou gives ms sonoda a boost in power to awaken her supernova status giving her the ability to become the scorpion man -like scorpion nova  スコーピオン・ノヴァ  sukōpion nova    this enables her to battle the now visibly stronger kamen rider fourze with her lower body capable of transforming into a large scorpion body with a gigantic tail being equal in size to the powerdizer when transformed her body in this form can also amass enough energy to destroy a city however the scheme fails as she is defeated by kamen rider fourze in space with his big space rider rocket drill kick spirited away by hayami with her identity protected ms sonodas zodiarts switch is taken away from her until she pleads gamou into giving it back to her in response to the appearance of kamen rider meteor however losing against kamen rider meteor shortly in a one-on-one fight ms sonoda is seemingly banished into the dark nebula by the virgo zodiarts as punishment for her repeated failures though later revealed to be alive and in suspended animation within the m-bus

  to create illusions to fool his targets though capable of holding his own in a fight the libra zodiarts is one of the weaker members within the horoscopes in terms of combat capabilities as he overwhelmed when the kamen riders have access to their upgrade forms he is a shrewd character with an inquisitive nature and has managed to prevail thus far due to him actively avoid direct confrontation with the kamen riders and undying loyalty to gamou true to the nature of his zodiarts form which is based on a star sign that takes the form of a scale hayami has a habit of using terms related to weight like light and heavy when talking to others in his first appearance before the kamen rider club he saves the unconscious ms sonoda while casting an illusion over her to protect her identity from kamen rider fourze hayami then reluctantly takes over her duties in the distribution of zodiarts switches targeting those among his prized pupils who have the potential to become horoscopes he also rarely intervenes with the businesses of his zodiarts recruits by fighting kamen rider fourze after ms sonoda is sent to the dark nebula hayami is ordered by a worrisome gamou to speed up his recruitment strategy playing an indirect role in bringing natsuji kijima into the horoscopes ranks not tolerating the newcomers blatant disrespect towards him on many levels hayami takes advantage of kijimas defeat by kamen rider meteor storm to get him sent into kijima into the dark nebula while he gives gamou the cancer switch using a field trip to kyoto have kamen rider fourzes presence reveal four altars gathering cosmic energy to the hole above the city with tatsugami assigned to oversee his progress hayami destroys the four altars so only the hole above aghs can amass cosmic energy though he succeeds his defeat by kamen rider fourze deems him as of no further use to gamou however hayamis desperation of being exiled causes him to manifest his supernova state in the form of the eye of laplace  ラプラスの瞳  rapurasu no hitomi    a power that enables him to see a persons fate of the stars  星の運命  hoshi no sadame   to see not only ones potential to become a horoscopes member but eventually locate other horoscopes switches with this newfound power gamou allows hayami to stay so they can put his new power in recruiting the capricorn aquarius and taurus zodiarts but as the final phase of gamous plan begins playing a role in emotos death and in dark yukis creation hayami begins to question the horoscopes goal and where he fits in it once his usefulness comes to an end before being welcomed into gamous inner circle as he learns the nature of the day of awakening as revealed in the net movies with tatsugami harassing him to no end hayami spends his time searching for the final horoscopes member by interviewing students before finally finding ran from there hayami formulates a scheme where he appears to betray gamou to ensure that ran becomes the pisces zodiarts giving his libra switch to the kamen rider club as a proof of his conviction before it ends up being tatsugami who secretly gives it back to him but once everything goes to plan hayami

armor than his regular cancer zodiarts form this amuses gamou even more although the chairman does muse behind kijimas back that the cancer zodiartss evolution is going too fast after being defeated in his supernova form by kamen rider meteors newly obtained meteor storm form kijima limps onto the aghs campus and drops his zodiarts switch which principal hayami takes though kijima pleads with the principal saying that he knows the true identity of kamen rider meteor and the information would prove useful enough to win back gamous favor hayami states his intent to do away with him regardless finding himself in the form of a meddling detective by hayamis illusion kijima is sent to the dark nebula by an unsuspecting virgo zodiarts after hayami talks her into it hayami later conceals his actions by claiming that kijima had died in battle unaware that kijima is actually in suspended animation within the m-bus as he gives gamou the cancer switch before it is entrusted to tatsugami the kanji 鬼 used in his surname is derived from kishuku  鬼宿    the japanese word for  ghost  the kanji that make up his given name natsuji  夏児   are read in the onyomi method as kani  かに    the japanese word for  crab  natsuji kijima is portrayed by soran tamoto  タモト 清嵐  tamoto soran      tatsumori yamada  山田 竜守  yamada tatsumori   is a transfer student at sbhs who is originally a quiet member of aghss drama club however upon arriving to subaruboshi high yamada used the zodiarts switch he obtained to become the lepus zodiarts before evolving into the sixth member of the horoscopes known as the aries zodiarts  アリエス・ゾディアーツ  ariesu zodiātsu    armed with a scepter called coppelius  コッペリウス  kopperiusu    the aries zodiarts emits an aura that can slow down or speed up a persons bodily functions allowing him to easily tire people out as well as rendering people unconscious while not shown to be powerful in direct combat the aries zodiartss ability to put his opponent to sleep makes him extremely dangerous regardless even to fellow horoscopes if he wants to he abuses this ability and developed a god complex to the point of totally disregarding the horoscopes interest in general and not meeting with gamou yamada transfers to subaruboshi high to break away from the chairmans scrutiny and takes on the title of the apostle of sleep  眠りの使徒  nemuri no shito   as he gets the entire school under his control and has everyone act in the roles he assigns them however being able to speed up bodily functions of a person means that he can easily revive someone as well he is eventually brought before the chairman by the virgo zodiarts and hayami advises to him to brace himself for a scolding to the principals surprise however gamou is rather delighted with yamadas performance in sbhs praising yamadas work so far to be very individualistic and gives him full permission to do as he pleases though ryusei is only looking for the aries zodiarts under tachibanas orders initially he sees a way to save jiro in the said zodiarts as a result against tachibanas orders ryusei decides to make a deal with yamada by killing kamen rider fourze to save jiro honoring his end of the bargin yamada proceeds to orchestrate the kamen rider clubs deaths when ryusei arrives to save them before gentaro overpowers the aries zodiarts as kamen rider fourze cosmic states enraged the aries zodiarts briefly transforms into aries nova  アリエス・ノヴァ  ariesu nova    with his horns changing shape while his eyes turn blue and his cape retracting though his full abilities in supernova form are not seen firing spheres of yellow energy at his opponent the aries zodiarts is defeated by kamen rider fourzes rider super galaxy finish as the resulting attack places him in a coma yamadas aries switch is retrieved by the virgo zodiarts and given to gamou who then gives it to tatsugami for safekeeping the kanji 山 used in his surname looks like an upside-down aries symbol the kanji that make up his given name tatsumori  竜守   translate into dragon guard referencing the dragon in the legend of the golden fleece of the ram aries tatsumori yamada is portrayed by kazuma kawahara  川原 一馬  kawahara

happens to be an old friend of jks from junior high school he is a rocker with a hearty appetite though his guitar playing is terrible goto is found by hayami using his eye of laplace to possess the potential to evolve from the lyra zodiarts unnamed into the capricorn zodiarts  カプリコーン・ゾディアーツ  kapurikōn zodiātsu    and is given a zodiarts switch prior to evolving into the said horoscopes member unlike other horoscopes members he bears no ill will to anyone and just wants to be big as a rocker as the capricorn zodiarts he is armed with an electric guitar like weapon called multi-stringed koto uruk  多弦琴 ウルク  tagenkin uruku   that is able to manipulate sound generating devastating sonic shock waves and entrancing people with his music as well as trapping people with a cosmic energy manifestation of the musical staff  the entranced people will go on a high for a period of time before suffering a serious adrenaline crash that can last for days the capricorn zodiarts can also use his music to resonate with certain switches with tatsugami setting up a theory that goto can find the core switch when gamou hears the hypothesis he is impressed and bestows the supernova powers to the capricorn zodiarts to increase the chance that they may succeed in this task after becoming one of the horoscopes goto tracks down jk to convince him to reform their band as the new gene god dark night carnival after discovering that jk is hosting the popular dj gene internet radio show improving jks singing and his guitar playing through his capricorn zodiarts forms powers however goto really wants to use the radio show as a means to brainwash their listeners into becoming crazed fans though it begins to weaken them overtime when jk discovers this he tries to cancel the program but goto reminds him of his fathers past which changes his mind and jk quits the kamen rider club upon revealing they will have a live show a few days later however gentaro having been taught a song by jks father that he used to sing to his son when growing up manages to get through to jk who realizes that he should not be attaining his dream like this despite gentaros poor guitar skills jks terrible singing and the capricorn zodiarts jeering gentaro manages to break his spell on the student body whom all flee when they see a zodiarts nearby thus infuriating him he battles kamen rider fourze once more but with jks return to gentaros circle of friends he is able to utilize cosmic states once more and the capricorn zodiarts is defeated before he can even use the supernova abilities gamou gave him goto is then spirited away to gamous headquarters where his capricorn switch is confiscated and his memory erased rather than being banished to the dark nebula as he confirmed the core switch is still active his surname is pronounced similarly to the english word  goat   ゴート  gōto    the word tōji in his given name is derived from tōji  冬至    winter solstice   additionally his rock star name

sees has robbed her father of his last chance to go to space her disdain of yuki grew further after a misunderstanding where she thought yuki had sabotaged her in the exam on the contrary thanks to yukis clever thinking erin is actually saved by yuki instead though she eventually manages to make peace with yuki erin states that they cannot be friends due to her respect and dedication to gamou as a horoscopes member these conflicting sentiments lead her to a conclusion that one of them must fall which ultimately leads her to have a final showdown with gentaro she is eventually defeated when

steadfastly onto the schools policies of allowing as much freedom as possible to the student body previously and constantly bickered with sayaka over idealistic differences this eventually indirectly led to her being injured and hospitalized and to everyones surprise he lost his cool seriously panicked and rushed to sayakas side immediately after hearing the news from shoko with his newfound powers motivated by his feelings for sayaka under the delusion that he is doing it for the right reasons sugiura creates the amanogawa campus bylaws various rules that limit the individuality of the student body as the taurus zodiarts his main power is to force people into keeping with a contracted promise through the use of his scepter called gu-anna  グアンナ  guanna   as well as taking peoples souls and turning them into loyal drones he is also physically imposing being both strong and fast in executing short range attacks sugiura nearly manages to get the entire school under his control before gentaro gets sayaka to convince sugiura to break his hold through her breaking a list of bylaws he imposed sugiura finally breaks down before her and gentaro as he is incapable of punishing her for he terrorized the school for her sake in the first place though the virgo zodiarts offers him a final chance to redeem himself the taurus zodiarts opts to fight the senior horoscopes instead

a doppelgänger of yuki jojima known as dark yuki  闇ユウキ  yami yūki    created when yuki is forced by the libra zodiarts and the leo zodiarts to activate a zodiarts switch as a result instead of melding into her zodiarts body the gemini switch causes the darkest aspects of her personality to be given a physical form that is identical to yuki but with a white mask that has blank expression on her face due to yukis passion for space gamou sees dark yuki as a kindred spirit due to yuki hearing the presenter as he had as the gemini zodiarts she has an unorthodox fighting style and is armed with two types of exploding cards red cards known as lynceus  リュンケウス  ryunkeus   that explode upon contact and the blue cards called idas  イーダス  Īdasu   that explode as the horoscopes wills them to her supernova ability allows the gemini zodiarts to produce a clone of herself that doubles as a living explosive as a result of the separation while acting on yukis darkest desires dark yuki reveals that she has a 24 hour window to usurp yuki as the dominant aspect while the original self ceases to be though she succeeds in that retrospect taking everything yuki has for her own dark yuki loses her dominance over yuki thanks to gentaro giving the girl a very strong memory to reverse the process after dark yuki is destroyed tatsugami retrieves the gemini switch for gamou an alternate romanization

friend haru kusao  she rejects his friendship outright due to a bad experience with senior students from her old middle school that convinced her to trust no student older than her and to protect haru however rans ideals led to haru to embrace being the musca zodiarts as he rejects her pleas to discard the zodiarts switch so she can protect him when haru throws away his friendship bracelet into the river ran goes to look for it on her own while refusing gentaros help but after gentaro found the bracelet with the kamen rider clubs help having not told him what she iss looking for ran decides to put her trust in her new seniors ran is able to snap haru out of his madness by apologizing for making him feel weak and useless through her protection allowing kamen rider fourze to destroy the musca zodiarts without any further psychological problems to deal with later afterwards she and haru both ask to join the kamen rider club and they are made provisional members until haru is fully recovered ran is later revealed to be the last predestined member of the horoscopes the pisces zodiarts  ピスケス・ゾディアーツ  pisukesu zodiātsu   with the ability to liquify herself swim through solid surfaces and shoot high pressure water streams though hayami attempted to keep her from becoming the pisces zodiarts ran is forced into transforming regardless when the leo zodiarts brutalizes the principal as she sees no other way to get out of the situation and save the principal though a member of the horoscopes her pisces switch starts out colored blue to signify its immaturity additionally ran still considers herself a part of the kamen rider club and resolves to use her newfound powers to fight gamou and tatsugami however this is all eventually revealed to be a setup as the hororscopes need her to activate the switch willingly as the pisces switch will not awaken unless activated and used willingly by the switcher principal hayami has tatsugami abduct haru to force ran into fully maturing her pisces switch before taking it from her ran is later taken to the hospital where haru looks after her before she returns to school and becomes an official kamen rider club member with him when ran

ほのか りん  honoka rin     mituaki gamou  我望 光明  gamō mitsuaki    previously referred to as the red-eyed man  赤い目の男  akai me no otoko    is amanogawa high schools school board chairman who often uses space metaphors in his speech as a child gamou heard the call of the presenters at the time of the apollo 11 exploration motivating him to join nasa and the russian federal space agency in attempts to fulfill his promise to meet them while extremely affable and encouraging of others in conversation gamou has ultimately always been friendless and finds the concept beneath him thinking of himself as the sun that all others revolve around this nature is compounded by his ability to hear the call of the presenters which led to gamous goal in life being to find a way of making contact and fulfilling what he sees as his destiny twenty years prior to the beginning of the series while a member of osto gamou and utahoshi found the core switch that the presenters sent to the moon as a test for sentient life in the solar system the two cracked the majority of the puzzle of the core switch but clashed over the method by which the presenters should be contacted with gamous egocentric nature leading him to favor the immediate forced evolution of humans into beings able to withstand the rigors of transwarp travel using zodiarts switches over utahoshis plan to create the fourze system which would take generations to complete three years after the finding gamou had emoto steal the completed zodiarts switches from the osto lunar station and murder utahoshi though emoto instead left him stranded on the moon a decade before the events of the series gamou built amanogawa high directly under the hole ostensibly in order to foster a love of space exploration in future generations but in reality with a funding arrangement set up with foundation x gamou utilized the school to create and raise zodiarts in order to find and gather all twelve members of the horoscopes for the day of awakening to that end gamou became one of the first horoscopes the powerful sagittarius zodiarts  サジタリウス・ゾディアーツ  sajitariusu zodiātsu   who can generate a bow on his left forearm called gilgamesh  ギルガメッシュ  girugamesshu   to unleash a barrage of cosmic energy arrows known as the apostolos  アポストロス  aposutorosu     like tatsugami it is seen that gamou can utilize other horoscopes switches but rarely does so as he prefers the overwhelming power of his own switch  because of his saturation with massive levels of negative cosmic energy even in his human form gamou is shown to possesses supernatural abilities such as giving other members of the horoscopes the ability to acquire supernova powers and the ability to conduct hypnotic suggestion that he uses on outsiders to drive them away thus keeping his true agenda a secret from prying eyes during the first half of the series gamou uses the principle he set up in his school to encourage the manifestation of individuality in students so that zodiarts selected from among them can do whatever pleases them in hope they can become horoscopes even if it means doing extensive damage to the school only the horoscopes members are accounted for if they are defeated by a kamen rider one time too many gamou almost sends principal hayami to the dark nebula for failing him too many times until he suddenly acquires the power known as the eye of laplace - the libra zodiarts supernova power convincing gamou to revoke banishment and get their horoscopes membership to ten while learning from tatsugami through gotos powers that the core switch still exists with only two horoscopes left after emoto reveals his true colors in aiding kamen riders fourze and meteor gamou makes himself known in his zodiarts form as he easily defeats the two kamen riders during the incident with the gemini zodiarts whom he had a personal interest in due to yuki having heard the presenter like he had gamou begins to suspect kengo to possess the core switch although he does not initially see the boy to be a threat his identity being revealed in the process gamous day of awakening is thwarted by kengo using his core child powers to negate the horoscopes switches knowing that kengo would need to die not only for the day of awakening to resume but also so that kengo would not get to the presenters before he does gamou elects to perform supernova on himself to attain the sagittarius nova  サジタリウス・ノヴァ  sajitariusu nova   form trading his bow and armor for a much lighter body in this state gamou can launch arrows from his left hand and perform a flying kick attack similar to a rider kick with his leg surrounded by an aura of negative cosmic energy resembling an arrow after sending the leo zodiarts to attack the rabbit hatch and lure out kengo who proceeds to leave earth gamou arrives and crushes the core switch that maintains kengos life though he believes he will succeed this time sagittarius nova finds himself facing kamen rider fourze in his various forms before being defeated by kamen rider fourzes rider rocket drill kick attack defeated and finally accepting gentaros ideals he accepts gentaros friendship but his body begins to evaporate into stardust due to side-effect of his forced evolution after asking the kamen rider club to meet the presenters in his stead gamou leaves to spend his final moments alone and use what little time he has left in mending the broken core switch with the aquarius zodiarts healing powers to resurrect kengo the kanji that comprise gamous given name can be translated as bright light  光明  kōmei    which is one of the epithets of the greek god apollo  apollo also was the god of archery linking gamou to sagittarius the archer mituaki gamou is portrayed by shingo tsurumi  鶴見 辰吾

the british rail mark 5 was the designation given to the planned passenger rolling stock for the intercity 250 project the mark 5 project was intended to produce new rolling stock for the west coast main line  which would be descended from the similar mark 4 stock in service on the east coast main line  the profile of the mark 5 coaches was designed for non-tilting operation unlike the briefly contemplated use of tilting mark 4 t stock on the west coast main line which is evident in the sloping sides of the mark 4 coaches the initial intention of intercity 250 was to build 30 full trains each consisting of a class 93 locomotive eight or nine 26 m long passenger coaches and a driving van trailer  the coaches would be capable of 155 mph 250 kmh and were specified to be equivalent in weight to the shorter mark 4 coaches which were felt to be overweight the decision to increase the length of the coaches to 26 m from the 23 m of the mark 4 was dictated by reduced maintenance costs following british rail studies which indicated that such a length was feasible within the uk loading gauge indeed in 1987 british rail had considered increasing the length of the mark 4 to 255 m but the in-service date of 1989 and complexity of changing the design to suit caused the variation order to be shelved  the mark 5 coaches would have been streamlined with powered plug fit doors while the interior of mockups designed by fm design  and constructed within marine plywood enclosures at british rails engineering development unit in the railway technical centre derby england during 1991 indicated a 22 seating arrangement in standard class 88 seats per coach with 21 in first class 52 seats per coach   the driving van trailer dvt would also have come under the mark 5 project remit these would have resembled the class 93 locomotives with luggage space and a driving cab similar to those commissioned for the intercity 225 project creating the class 93s alone would have cost £380 million with limited funding after the east coast main line project was completed the costs were deemed too high and the project was terminated after the intercity 250 project was scrapped virgin trains  who have operated the west coast main line franchise since the privatisation of british rail  commissioned new rolling stock in the form of class 390 electric multiple units —rather than the class 93 locomotive and separate mark 5 carriages proposed by british rail current  when  network rail track design standards use the mark 5 coach to represent coaching stock with a 19m bogie centre

turkish cinema is an important part of turkish culture  and has flourished over the years delivering entertainment to audiences in turkey  expatriates across europe  more recently prospering in the arab world and in rare cases the united states  yeşilçam green pine refers to the old turkish film industry in terms of film production turkey shared the same fate with many of the national cinemas of the 20th century film production wasnt continuous until around the 1950s and the film market in general was run by a few major import companies that struggled for domination in the most population-dense and profitable cities such as istanbul and izmir film theatres rarely ever screened any locally produced films and the majority of the programs consisted of films of the stronger western film industries especially those of the usa france italy and germany attempts at film production came primarily from multinational studios which could rely on their comprehensive distribution networks together with their own theatre chains thus guaranteeing them a return on their investment between the years 1896–1945 the number of locally produced films did not even reach 50 films in total equal to less than a single years annual film production domestically produced films constituted of only a small fraction of the total number of films screened in turkey prior to the 1950s this would rapidly change after world war ii with a total of 49 films produced in 1952 this single year equaled a greater output produced in turkey than all previous years during the 60s turkey became the fifth biggest film producer world wide and annual film production reached the 300 film benchmark just at the beginning of the 70s compared to other national cinemas the achievements of the turkish film industry after 1950 are still remarkable however the impact of tv and video as the new popular media and political turmoil in the 70s often hand in hand with deep economic crises caused a sharp drop in ticket sales resulting in a steady decline starting around 1980 and continuing until the mid-90s the number of annual ticket sales decreased from a peak of 90 million tickets in 1966  to 56 million tickets in 1984 and only 11 million in 1990  accordingly the number of film theatres declined from approximately 2000 theatres in 1966  to 854 in 1984 and 290 in 1990  during the 1990s the average number of films produced per year remained between 10-15 usually half of them not even making it into the theatres since 1995 the situation has improved after the year 2000 annual ticket sales rose to 20 million and since 1995 the number of theatres steadily increased to approximately 500 theatres country-wide currently turkish films attract audiences of millions of viewers and routinely top the blockbuster lists often surpassing foreign films at the box office however it is difficult to speak about the existence of an industry since most films are rather individual projects of directors who otherwise earn their living in television advertising or theatre the distribution of these films are mainly handled by multinational corporations such as warner bros and united international pictures most of the turkish films produced before 1950 were projects initiated by import companies owned by local families most notably İpek film  a daughter company of the İpek merchandise an import company that already existed in the 19th century as can be seen in their adverts published in ottoman literary journals such as servet-i-fünun  another important company in the early era of turkish cinema was kemal film  a company whose  continuous presence as a leading import company has been often overseen for a few local films it produced during the 1920s it is interesting to note that the founders of kemal film bought their first film camera on loan from the ipek merchandise both companies would be the strongest film distributors until the 1950s and the only companies that were financially sound enough to produce films themselves with low risks for financial failure as they already were in possession of a distribution-system and theatre chains that guaranteed a return-of-investment however the notable developments of these companies must be seen as necessary adaptations to the technological progress of the western film industries whose films they were importing one example here being the establishment of the marmara dubbing studio in the early 1930s when the silent era came to an end in the west and sound-films became the standard prompting the import-dependent companies to adjust themselves to the new technological requirements the big distributors in istanbul led by İpek film and kemal film gradually expanded their distribution-system throughout the rest of the country during the 1930s leading to the so-called regional system  bölge İşletmeleri  which consisted of seven distribution areas with their headquarters being established in the most significant cities in those regions istanbul marmara region İzmir aegaean region ankara middle anatolian region samsun black sea region adana mediterranean region erzurum east anatolian region and diyarbakir south east anatolian region  the regional system became much more important after the 1950s when local film production dramatically increased and local films surpassed import-films in both ticket-sales and revenues this system became the financial fundament of yeşilçam often referred to as turkish hollywood which was the heart of turkish film production between the years 1955–1975 after 1965 a so-called combined-system  kombine sistem led by a trust of some regional leaders is said to have taken control on almost everything regarding production  a leading figure of the trust was producer türker İnanoğlu who is still active in the media business today now running ulusal film  turkeys largest tv production company the first film showing in turkey was held in the yıldız palace  istanbul in 1896 public shows by sigmund weinberg in the beyoğlu and sehzadebasi districts followed in 1897 weinberg was already a prominent figure at that time especially known as the a representative of foreign companies such as pathé for whom he sold gramophones before he got into the film business in some sources he is also mentioned as a photographer again as a result of being one of the representatives of foreign companies such as kodak-goldmann the first turkish movie a documentary produced by fuat uzkinay in 1914 depicted the destruction of the russian monument in ayastefanos by the public the first thematic turkish films were  the marriage of himmet aga  1916–1918 started by weinberg and completed by uzkinay  the paw  1917 and  the spy  1917 both by sedat simavi  the army-affiliated central cinema directorate a semi-military national defense society and the disabled veterans society were the producing organizations of that period in 1922 a major documentary film   independence the İzmir victory  was made about the first war of independence the same year the first private movie studio  kemal film commenced operations from 1923 to 1939 muhsin ertugrul was the only film director in the country he directed 29 films during this period generally incorporating adaptions of plays operettas  fiction and foreign films the influence of the theater dating back to uzkinay simavi ahmet fehim and karagozoglu is very strong in muhsin ertugruls work the years between 1939 and 1950 were a period of transition for turkish cinema  during which it was greatly influenced by the theater as well as by world war ii  while there were only two film companies in 1939 the number increased to four between 1946 and 1950 after 1949 turkish cinema was able to develop as a separate art with a more professional caliber of talents yesilçam green pine is a metonym for the turkish film industry similar to hollywood in the united states  yeşilçam is named after yeşilçam street in the beyoğlu district of istanbul where many actors directors crew members and studios were based yeşilçam experienced its heyday from the 1950s to the 1970s when it produced 250 to 350 films annually after the 1970s yeşilçam suffered due to the spread of television in turkey however yeşilçam has seen a revival since 2002 having produced critically acclaimed movies such as uzak  grand prix cannes film festival 2003  babam ve oğlum and propaganda  between 1950 and 1966 more than fifty movie directors practiced film arts in turkey Ömer lütfi akad strongly influenced the period but osman fahir seden  atıf yılmaz  and memduh Ün made the most films the film susuz yaz dry summer  made by metin erksan  won the golden bear award at the berlin film festival in 1964 the number of cinemagoers and the number of films made record a constant increase especially after 1958 in the 1960s the programs of the theater departments in the language history and geography faculties of ankara university and istanbul university included cinema courses as did the press and publications high school of ankara university a cinema branch was also established in the art history department of the state fine arts academy  the union of turkish film producers and the state film archives both date from  the 1960s the state film archives became the turkish film archives in 1969 during the same period the cinema-tv institute was founded and annexed to the state academy of fine arts  the turkish state archives also became part of this organization in 1962 the cinema-tv institute became a department of mimar sinan university  well-known directors of the 1960–1970 period include metin erksan atıf yılmaz memduh Ün halit refiğ  duygu sağıroğlu  remzi aydın jöntürk and nevzat pesen  in 1970 the numbers of cinemas and cinemagoers rose spectacularly in 2424 cinemas films were viewed by a record number of 247 million viewers in 1970 approximately 220 films were made and this figure reached 300 in 1972 turkish cinema gave birth to its legendary stars at this period notable examples being kemal sunal  kadir İnanır  türkan Şoray and Şener Şen  after this period however the cinema began to lose its audiences due to nationwide tv broadcasts after 1970 a new and young generation of directors emerged but they had to cope with an increased demand for video films after 1980 increased production costs and difficulties faced in the import of raw materials brought about a decrease in the number of films made in the 1970s but the quality of films improved however the fall of cinemas popularity continued in the early nineties there were barely two or three movies released for a year during this period most of the seventies stars had either moved to tv or were trying to rebuild the yeşilçam s former glory some of the notable examples of this era are eşkıya english the bandit  and züğürt ağa english the agha  both starring Şener Şen  both movies were critically and commercially acclaimed however the rise of yesilçam didnt take place until the release of vizontele  the film was directed written and starred by yılmaz erdoğan  who was praised by his long-running sit-com bir demet tiyatro  and his dedication to theatre the movie starred the cast of his usual plays most notably demet akbağ  altan erkekli  and cem yılmaz  this movies huge commercial success watched by 25 million viewers which earned the movie the most viewed film for its day brought attention to the industry a few years later cem yılmaz released his own film gora  which he both wrote and starred in this and vizonteles sequel vizontele tuuba broke vizontele s records by achieving 35 and 3 million viewers respectively since then larger-budgeted films produced notable examples being kurtlar vadisi irak english valley of the wolves iraq  continuing the story of the controversial series kurtlar vadisi  reached 4 million viewers and still holds the record babam ve oğlum english my father and my son  cem yılmazs second movie hokkabaz english the magician   there has been a rise in more experimental films in the 2000s notably the 2005 feature türev was filmed without a prewritten script and even featured candid shots of the actors anlat istanbul istanbul tales an ensemble piece divided into five mini films got a strong reception the production numbers also soared in the second half of the 2000s with 40 films in 2007 and top 4 box office hits in 2007 claimed by turkish films as the film industry became profitable again with improving technical quality corresponding with commercial films production costs increasing  although the need for a cinema law has been very often raised throughout the history of the turkish republic until 1986 no specific law or regulation has been developed while films have been usually treated as goods and were in that regard subject to laws regarding taxation content-wise they were controlled by commissions that have been often criticized for being mechanism of censorship in the 1930s some members of the parliament raised the issue whether films would have a bad impact on children this was a popular theme at that time not just in turkey but also in the usa for example see payne foundation studies  later on in the 1960s a debate around the so-called baykam-law became quite famous for the tension it created amongst the parliamentarians and the stakeholders in the industry in 1977 and 1978 some further discussions for a cinema law have been held but without any result in 1986 finally a cinema law though highly criticised by members of the industry and the cinema intelligentsia of that time has been passed by the parliament and is since then the fundamental legislative document regarding cinema issues in turkey on january 23 1986 a new cinema law aimed to ensure support for those working in cinema and music  a reorganization of the film industry began in 1987 to address problems and assure its development the ministry of culture established the professional union of owners of turkish works of cinema the same year the copyrights and general directorate of cinema was founded in 1989 as well as a support fund for the cinema and musical arts this fund is used to provide financial support to the film sector one of the most interesting studies on the issue of film censorship in turkey is alim Şerif onaran s sinematografik hürriyet cinematic freedom published in 1968 by the ministry of internal affairs but written in 1963 and being the first study in turkey which received a phd for a topic related to film this study is still the most important -if not only- study on the film evaluation methods applied in turkey before the 1950s onaran himself being active as a member of the film rating commission in his younger years was a true expert on the topic and his research includes also examples of the late ottoman period ironically onaran became one of the most important intellectuals on film in turkey owing his wealth of knowledge on early world film history to the years he spent watching the films he was enrolled to evaluate as a committee member a very interesting example on the level of absurdity that censorship could reach is mentioned in Çetin yetkins book siyasal iktidar sanata karşı political regime vs art published in 1970 it tells the story of a film which was classified as inappropriate for export because the evaluation committee decided that the film contains communist propaganda the film-owner who applied to the committee for being granted an export-certificate was surprised to see the decision because he mentioned on his application form that his intention was to sell a copy of the film to a distributor in the soviet union the worlds leading communist country at that time 
a garbage disposal unit  waste disposal unit  or garburator is a device usually electrically powered installed under a kitchen sink between the sinks drain and the trap which shreds food waste into pieces small enough—generally less than 2 mm 0079 in—to pass through plumbing   garbage disposal units are widely used in north american households but far less commonly used elsewhere the garbage disposal was invented in 1927 by john w hammes an architect working in racine wisconsin   he received us patent 2012680 for a garbage disposal device in 1935 after eleven years of development his insinkerator company put his disposer on the market in 1940 hammes claim is disputed as general electric introduced a garbage disposal unit in 1935   in many cities in the united states in the 1930s and the 1940s the municipal sewage system had regulations prohibiting placing food waste garbage into the system insinkerator spent considerable effort and was highly successful in convincing many localities to rescind these prohibitions  many localities in north america mandated the use of disposers  for many years garbage disposals were illegal in new york city because of a perceived threat of damage to the citys sewer system after a 21-month study with the nyc department of environmental protection  the ban was rescinded in 1997 by local law 1997071 which amended section 24-5181 nyc administrative code  in 2008 the city of raleigh north carolina attempted a ban on the replacement and installation of garbage disposals which also extended to outlying towns sharing the citys municipal sewage system but rescinded the ban one month later   in the us some 50 of homes had disposal units as of 2009  compared with only 6 in the united kingdom   in sweden some municipalities encourage the installation of disposers so as to increase the production of biogas  some local authorities in britain subsidise the purchase of garbage disposal units in order to reduce the amount of waste going to landfill   food scraps range from 10 to 20 of household waste  and are a problematic component of municipal waste creating public health sanitation and environmental problems at each step beginning with internal storage and followed by truck-based collection burned in waste-to-energy facilities the high water-content of food scraps means that their heating and burning consumes more energy than it generates buried in landfills  food scraps decompose and generate methane gas which is a greenhouse gas   the premise behind the proper use of a disposal is to effectively regard food scraps as liquid averaging 70 water like human waste and use existing infrastructure underground sewers and wastewater treatment plants for its management modern wastewater plants are effective at processing organic solids into fertilizer products known as biosolids with advanced facilities also capturing methane for energy production    a high- torque  insulated electric motor  usually rated at 250–750 watts ⅓ to 1 horsepower  for a domestic unit spins a circular  turntable mounted horizontally above it induction motors rotate at 1400–1800 rpm and have low starting torque  the added weight and size of induction motors may be of concern depending on the available installation space and construction of the sink bowl universal motors rotate at higher speeds about 2800 rpm have high starting torque and are usually lighter but are noisier than induction motors partially due to the higher speeds and partially because the commutator brushes rub on the slotted armature   the higher starting torque of those appliances with a permanent magnet motor ensures in most cases that there will be no blockage inside the grinding chamber there is a rotating metal turntable onto which the food waste drops two swiveling metal impellers mounted on top of the plate near the edge then fling the food waste against the grind ring repeatedly grooves in the grind ring break down the waste until it is small enough to pass through openings in the ring whereupon it is flushed down the drain usually there is a partial rubber closure on the top of the disposal unit to prevent food waste from flying back up out of the grinding chamber it may also be used to attenuate noise from the grinding chamber for quieter operation many high-end or commercial disposals have an additional blade attached beneath the turntable the purpose of this blade is to chop up stringy food waste that would otherwise bypass the grind ring and clog the pipework there are two main types of garbage disposals — continuous feed and batch feed continuous feed models are used by feeding in waste after being started  continuous feed models are  more common batch feed units are used by placing waste inside the unit before being started these types of units are  started by placing a specially designed cover over the opening and twisting it to allow magnets in the cover to align with magnets in the unit  because it is covered during operation it is quieter than continuous feed models  small slits in the cover allow water to flow through batch feed models are also safer since the top of the disposal is covered during operation preventing foreign objects from falling in waste disposal units may jam but can usually be cleared either by forcing the turntable round from above or by turning the motor using a hex-key wrench inserted into the motor shaft from below very hard objects accidentally or deliberately introduced such as metal cutlery can damage the waste disposal unit and become damaged themselves more problematic are drain blockages caused by shredded waste that is fibrous eg  artichoke leaves or starchy eg  potato peelings some higher-end units have an automatic reversing jam clearing feature by using a slightly more-complicated centrifugal starting switch  the split-phase motor rotates in the opposite direction from the previous run each time it is started this can clear minor jams but is claimed to be unnecessary by some manufacturers since the late 1970s most disposal units have swivel impellers which make reversing unnecessary  another kind of garbage disposal unit the hydromaid is powered by water pressure rather than electricity and is manufactured by hydromaid international instead of the turntable and grind ring described above this alternative design has a water-powered unit with an oscillating piston with blades attached to chop the waste into fine pieces  because of this cutting action they can handle fibrous waste water-powered units take longer than electric ones for a given amount of waste and need fairly high water pressure to function properly  for a period of time in the mid-late 2000s the hydromaid virtually disappeared from the commercial marketplace the manufacturer filed for bankruptcy protections under chapter 11 title 11 united states code in 2007  as of october 2011 however hydromaid disposals are available again via several online retailers including amazoncom  kitchen waste disposal units increase the load of organic carbon that reaches water treatment plant which in turn increases the consumption of oxygen  metcalf  eddy quantified this impact as 004 pound of biochemical oxygen demand per person per day where disposers are used  an australian study that compared in-sink food processing to composting alternatives via a life cycle assessment found that while the in-sink disposal performed well with respect to climate change acidification and energy usage it did contribute to eutrophication and toxicity potentials safe use of disposals is enhanced by employing the which switch identifier to ensure the correct walltoggle switch is used to engage potentially dangerous grinding units found in most disposals  this may result in higher costs for energy needed to supply oxygen in secondary operations however if the waste water treatment is finely controlled the organic carbon in the food may help to keep the bacterial decomposition running as carbon may be deficient in that process this increased carbon serves as an inexpensive and continuous source of carbon necessary for biologic nutrient removal  one result is larger amounts of solid residue from the waste-water treatment process according to a study at the east bay municipal utility district ’s wastewater treatment plant funded by the epa food waste produces three times the biogas as compared to municipal sewage sludge  the value of the biogas produced from anaerobic digestion of food waste appears to exceed the cost of processing the food waste and disposing of the residual biosolids based on a lax airport proposal to divert 8000 tonsyear of bulk food waste  in a study at the hyperion los angeles sewage treatment works disposer use showed minimal to no impact on the total biosolids byproduct from sewage treatment and similarly minimal impact on handling processes as the high volatile solids destruction vsd from food waste yield a minimum amount of solids in residue  energy usage is not high typically 500 - 1500 w of power is used comparable to an electric iron  but only for a very short time totaling approximately 3-4 kwh of electricity per household per year  daily water usage varies but is typically one gallon of water per person per day  comparable to an additional toilet flush  one survey of these food processing units found a slight increase in household water use 
châteauguay-laprairie was a former provincial electoral district in the province of quebec  canada  many sources including the national assembly website write it as châteauguay-la prairie  but contemporary sources show the laprairie part of the name written as one word   this alternate way of spelling it is probably by analogy with the modern-day la prairie electoral district which was spelled laprairie before 1988  it was created for the 1939 election  from parts of the châteauguay and napierville-laprairie electoral districts  it existed for only that one election  it disappeared in the 1944 election and its successor electoral district was the recreated châteauguay

with no interceptions while the giants defense shut down the falcons the only atlanta points coming from a safety given up by mannings intentional grounding penalty in his end zone the giants then moved on to face the no 1 seed and the defending super bowl xlv champion green bay packers in the divisional round the giants never trailed in the game winning 37–20 one of the key plays in the game was a hail mary pass by manning to hakeem nicks  giving new york a 20–10 lead at the end of the first half as they did to 2007 mvp tom brady the patriots record-breaking offense  the giants generated significant pressure on packers quarterback and season mvp aaron rodgers  sacking him four times and disrupting his talented receiving corps  this was the first time in nfl history a 15–1 team failed to make it past the divisional round in the playoffs the giants faced the no 2 seed san francisco 49ers in the nfc championship game after a series of defensive standoffs in the fourth quarter the game went into overtime both teams continued to struggle on offense until new york linebacker jacquian williams stripped the ball from san francisco wide receiver kyle williams after a punt return the giants recovered the ball at the 49ers 24-yard line setting up a 31-yard field goal attempt by giants kicker lawrence tynes  unlike cundiff earlier that day tynes kick was successful giving the giants a 20–17 victory the patriots as the designated home team had a choice of wearing their home navy blue jerseys or their white away jerseys briefly there was speculation that the patriots might wear the white away jerseys in order to switch the jerseys from super bowl xlii  where the patriots wore dark blue and the giants wore white  also the giants are 4–0 in playoff games in their white away jerseys since the 2007 season  however the patriots announced on the monday following the conference championship games that they would be wearing their customary navy blue home jerseys as the home team in super bowl xlvi  hospitality experts speculated that indianapolis will have seen the most severe hotel price gouging in super bowl history the city has 6000 hotel rooms fewer than typical for a super bowl host city some rooms in downtown indianapolis reportedly cost more than 4000 a night by contrast rooms close to the stadium in previous super bowls were usually available for about 200 the room shortage and high prices caused some attendees to plan to stay in chicago 180 miles away and ride buses to events  because the giants and patriots drew their fan bases from new york city and boston respectively the super bowl echoed the fierce rivalry between the new york yankees and the boston red sox in major league baseball    tom brady said of the rivalry there is a great rivalrybetween boston and new yorkwhen i got to the team it was always red sox-yankees we’ve had some pretty meaningful games against the giants over the past few years so i don’t think anyone is

nfc team won the coin toss  new york opened the game with a drive to the patriots 33-yard line threatening to score first  after giving up a 19-yard reception to giants wide receiver hakeem nicks  new englands defense stepped up to prevent a score defensive lineman brandon deaderick sacked eli manning for a 2-yard loss then giants running back ahmad bradshaw was tackled behind the line of scrimmage on a blitz by patriots cornerback kyle arrington  on third down new england defensive end mark anderson sacked manning pushing the giants out of field goal range and forcing a giants punt new york got a boost from punter steve weatherford  whose 36-yard kick pinned the pats back at their own 6-yard line  on the patriots first offensive play tom brady attempted a play action pass  but a heavy rush from giants defensive lineman justin tuck forced a deep throw into the middle of the field with no receiver anywhere near it brady was flagged for intentional grounding  and since he was in the end zone when he threw the pass the play resulted in a safety   giving new york a 2–0 lead it was the first safety in a championship game since super bowl xliii  after receiving the free kick new york drove 78 yards in 9 plays—including a key 24-yard run by ahmad bradshaw—and increased their lead to 9–0 on mannings 2-yard touchdown pass to victor cruz  on the following drive tom brady completed passes to benjarvus green-ellis for 7 yards deion branch for 15 and wes welker for 19 moving the ball to the giants 31-yard line  new york managed to stop the drive at their own 11-yard line but stephen gostkowski kicked a 29-yard field goal for new englands first score early in the second quarter the giants punted on the next drive then held the patriots to a three-and-out when new yorks next drive stalled weatherfords 51-yard punt gave the patriots possession on their 4-yard line brady however completed eight consecutive passes for 71 yards and threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to running back danny woodhead  giving the patriots a 10–9 halftime lead the drive went for 14 plays and covered 96 yards tying the record for the longest drive in super bowl history new england took the second half kickoff and started out strong brady completed a 21-yard pass to chad ochocinco his only reception of the postseason and two rushes by green-ellis gained 25 yards to the new york 33-yard line brady eventually finished the 8-play 79-yard drive with a 12-yard touchdown pass to tight end aaron hernandez  increasing new englands lead to 17–9 starting the following drive from their own 35-yard line after jerrel jernigan s 34-yard kickoff return new york responded with a drive to  patriots 20-yard line where giants kicker lawrence tynes converted a 38-yard field goal cutting the score to 17–12 on the next drive new york forced a three-and-out—including a justin tuck sack of brady on third down—and will blackmon returned zoltan mesko s 43-yard punt 10 yards to the patriots 47-yard line  new york subsequently drove back into scoring range on a drive that utilized several different players including a 12-yard reception by seldom used tight end bear pascoe to reach the new england 9-yard line on third down however a sack by  new englands anderson and rob ninkovich forced new york to settle for another tynes field goal making the score 17–15 with 35 seconds left in the third quarter on the second play of the fourth quarter the first turnover of the game occurred when giants linebacker chase blackburn picked off a deep brady pass at the new york 8-yard line  new york then drove to the patriots 43-yard line but were stopped there and had to punt new england took the ball back at their own eight-yard line with less than ten minutes in the fourth quarter with 406 left in the game new england snapped the ball at the giants 44-yard line on 2nd-and-11 and tom brady threw to an uncovered wes welker had the pass been completed the play would have completed a key first down for the patriots even more so since the giants had only one of their timeouts remaining however bradys pass was high and welker was unable to reel it in while falling to the ground then on 3rd-and-11 new england could not get a first down and new englands drive stalled on the giants 44-yard line and they were forced to punt the tv footage of the game showed bill belichick exhorting his defense to focus on stopping victor cruz and hakeem nicks and to force the giants to go to secondary options mario manningham and pascoe the giants took possession from their own 12-yard line with 346 left in the game and one timeout  on the first play in what would end up being one of the key plays of the game  manning completed a deep pass along the left sideline to manningham for a 38-yard gain to midfield new england coach bill belichick challenged the catch but the call on the field stood and it cost him his teams first timeout  two more completions from manning to manningham gained another 18 yards  manning then completed a 14-yard pass to nicks on the new england 18-yard line at the two-minute warning  two plays later new england called their second timeout with 103 left after bradshaws one-yard run gave new york a 2nd down and goal on the six-yard line with the patriots down to their last timeout and ahead by two points 17–15 the possibility existed that the giants would run a play to stop short of the goal line which would have forced the patriots to use that timeout to stop the clock on any of the last two plays the giants could run the clock down allow tynes—who had not missed under 30 yards in four years—to kick a winning field goal and give the patriots only about 20 seconds of play left to score again this also meant that the patriots could call a defensive play where they would purposely allow the giants to score a touchdown which despite giving up the lead would allow the patriots to get the ball back without the timeout and with more time remaining new england chose to let new york score opening its defense to let bradshaw enter the end zone with the ball in what sports illustrated later called perhaps the strangest play in super bowl history realizing what the patriots were doing bradshaw attempted to stop on the 1-yard line but his forward momentum caused him to fall into the end zone for a touchdown    the intentionally surrendered touchdown gave the patriots 57 seconds to score again and they went into their final drive trailing by a 21–17 count after the giants failed to convert a two-point play   the games final drive began on the new england 20-yard line bradys first two passes fell incomplete and then he was sacked by tuck on third down leaving the patriots 16 yards from a first down and forcing them to use their final timeout facing heavy pressure in the pocket brady eluded linebacker michael boley and then threw a bullet to deion branch branch caught the ball and ran out of bounds at the 33-yard line for a first down an 11-yard completion from brady to hernandez advanced the ball to the pats 44 followed by a twelve-men on the field penalty against the giants which moved the ball to the patriots 49 with 9 seconds left after an incomplete pass brady on the games final play threw a hail mary pass intended for hernandez in the end zone but the ball was deflected by giants defenders tight end rob gronkowski dove with outstretched arms toward the ball but was still a yard away when it hit the ground ending super bowl xlvi and giving new york their fourth super bowl win in franchise history at lucas oil stadium  indianapolis  indiana for the giants manning completed 30 of 40 passes for 296 yards one touchdown and no interceptions bradshaw was the top rusher of the game with 72 yards and a

6 total tackles and an interception  tuck made 3 tackles and two sacks  for new england brady completed 27 of 41 passes for 276 yards and two touchdowns with one interception becoming the first quarterback to throw a touchdown pass in five separate super bowls  his top target was hernandez who caught 8 passes for 67 yards and one score  welker added 7 receptions for 60 yards and two carries for 21  gronkowski who came into super bowl xlvi battling an ankle injury was held to just two receptions for 26 yards  linebackers jerod mayo and brandon spikes each had 8 solo tackles 3 assists and

lang  legendary promoter of the woodstock festival of 1969 the sound-outs were kind of the spark for the woodstock festival the sound-outs just had a great feel and it was in the country and it provided all the guidelines that i needed and i was sort of thinking of a broader event but with the same kind of emotional impact 7 by 1969 the woodstock sound festivals were under the direction of cyril caster an ambitious schedule of eight events was planned but due to inclement weather only one was successfully staged performers like paul butterfield  tim hardin  happy  artie traum van morrison  children of god and the colwell-winfield blues band  played at the event that summer 8 the following year ian hain became president of woodstock sound festival inc working with pan copeland

speckled bird  larry coryell  ellen mcilwaine  procol harum and holy moses hain was successful in staging a three-day event over the july 4th weekend however due to legal pressure the concert for the july 25 weekend was reduced to one day hain was arrested on july 25 when attendees surpassed the allowed limit and reached 210 9 he fought his case through the courts and by september 9 the case was dismissed but the season was over 10 the sound-outs at pan copeland’s fields ended but the idea lived on and was resurrected in 2008 in that year on august 9 a contemporary sound-out was held—in

  serge a storms is the main fictional character in most of tim dorsey s novels and appears in all of them to date his name is a pun on storm surge  in most of dorseys books storms is in his mid-forties in age he is described as tall and thin but muscular with dark hair shot through with gray serge has been diagnosed with a variety of mental illnesses  and has been prescribed a cocktail of drugs to keep him stable these are effective but he often refuses to take them since he dislikes their effects free from the drugs influence he quickly becomes manic and obsessive about trivial things he frequently acts as an extremely eccentric tour guide for whoever happens to be handy despite his psychological disorders serge is for the most part a charismatic likeable person he can be viewed as a somewhat more liberal version of joseph heller s yossarian  when an event or person offends his extremely strong and subjective sense of justice  however he can quickly fly into a homicidal rage he has committed a string of murders for which the police pursue him as a serial killer   serge acts as an independent vigilante who dispenses rough creative and immediate death penalties for low-life criminals somewhat in the style of death wish film and its sequels starring charles bronson  all aspects of the history of florida  whether political ecological or sociological are of intense interest to serge  he is often seized with a sudden urge to visit landmarks although their significance is frequently personal or related to popular culture  rather than historical serge usually documents such visits with copious amounts of photographs and keeps a box full of florida-related memorabilia 
serge also has a varied taste in music ranging from modern urban to the beatles and the rolling stones  all of which can be described as very tasteful and fitting to his personality serge has started a personal religion based on football coach don shula  where salvation is obtained by successfully eating the 48-ounce steak at shulas steakhouse   serge appears to be partly inspired by travis mcgee  a fictional florida based independent salvage consultant and crime-solver featured in many novels by john d mcdonald  serge was born during the cuban missile crisis   he might age in real time  in triggerfish twist  serge has turned 35  nine books later in hurricane punch  hes 44  being 44 causes him to go through a midlife crisis causing him to have a religious awakening and to go on a come back killing spree storms great great grandfather came to the us in the 1880s from cuba  he worked as a reader in a cigar factory in ybor city  but left after his boss disproved of the material he was reading to the other workers he then ran a bolita lottery for a local gang the game was supposed to be fixed and the gang killed him when he made a mistake in the scheme  serge was named after his grandfather sergio a con artist who shared some of his grandsons passion for historical trivia sergio also seemed to share serges sense of ethics as one of his last major cons involved swindling money from investor who themselves swindled the residents of a farming community in alabama  sergio was thought to have committed suicide when serge was a child but during the novel cadillac beach its discovered that he is still alive the elder storms had a heart attack not long after his grandsons 44th birthday and died after a short stay in hospital  storms father pablo was a cuban american jai alai player who was more popular for his unpredictability than his skill at the sport he died when he hurled a pelota that rebounded and struck him forcefully in the head this occurred when serge was very young and left his mother a widowed single mother she had an affair with another jai alai player from spain which resulted in pregnancy since she could barely cope with one child and had no support from the father he went back to spain she gave up her second son for adoption  ford oelman is serges half-brother the child given up for adoption by his mother oelman was raised in alabama  and did not find out about the adoption until he was an adult he was reunited with sergio when the older man was in alabama  but did not meet with serge until after their grandfather had died ford moved to california with his friend mark to fulfill his ambition of becoming a screen writer  in the books florida roadkill and triggerfish twist  serges companions are a cold-hearted stripper named sharon rhodes and an idiotic drug addict named seymore coleman bunsen both of these characters appear to die in florida roadkill  they both return for the later novel triggerfish twist which takes place sometime before the events of florida roadkill  coleman returns permanently in torpedo juice  and has been serges sidekick in most of the novels since while coleman is presumed dead serge travels with lenny lipowicz whom he meets in hammerhead ranch motel  lipowicz is a don johnson lookalike who is a stoner much like coleman but slightly and only slightly more intelligent lenny lives with his mother and her dog though he frequently leaves the house for days without notifying or contacting her  aside from hammerhead ranch motel  lenny has been in cadillac beach  and the stingray shuffle   he also appeared in  atomic lobster  in which he and coleman meet and indulge in their shared pathological fondness for marijuana  its unknown if he will ever return as a character serges methods of killing people are frequently quite inventive and often provide a highly improbable— but technically possible— escape route  as an example in triggerfish twist storms ties up a man in a garden shed so that he can stand but not walk  placing a hula hoop around the mans waist serge soaks the surrounding ground with gasoline and connects a floodlight with the glass removed to a motion sensor  thus the trap is set if the man stops twirling the hoop the motion sensor will activate the floodlight igniting the gasoline if the man can maintain the hula hoops motion for several hours the gasoline will evaporate  and he will eventually be rescued needless to say the victim fails to display the necessary endurance and perishes in the ensuing fire other methods include putting the tube from a can of fix-a-flat down a would be killers trachea and pushing the trigger kidnapping a man spying on him and killing him through alcohol poisoning he inserts a funnel in the mans rectum pours a liberal amount of rum into the funnel and into the mans colon then corking up his victim with a bar of soap he then releases the victim who runs screaming for help down the street because the alcohol is absorbed rapidly through the colon walls the man quickly becomes increasingly intoxicated and pedestrians laugh at him as merely being drunk eventually he is unable to speak or stand and collapses in an alcohol-induced coma and dies shortly thereafter his bac goes from 00 to 03 in a matter of minutes as the series progresses however serge seems to begin to abandon these overly intricate methods in torpedo juice  he kills a petty mugger by forcing him to swallow a handful of bullets  then subjecting him to a mri leaving police to marvel at a corpse featuring numerous exit wounds but no visible entry wounds later in the same novel however serge kills a boorish drunk via the relatively mundane method of kicking him to death still later he fills an obnoxious mans scuba tank with nitrous oxide  leading to his death during serges underwater wedding fittingly enough to the strains of pink floyd s comfortably numb  in atomic lobster serge and coleman are kept very busy in and around tampa and on a cruise ship as serge continues to clean up florida by dispatching many members of the criminal element  serge employs many innovative methods of terminating florida low-life using common household items available at neighborhood hardware or sporting goods stores  serges methods reflect attention to physics chemistry and news stories of true crime and popular science in gator-a-go-go serge once again utilizes some creative methodology in his killings in one instance he removes the lap bar from an enormous bungee swing ride and places a gangster whom he has bound and gagged in the seat when the ride activates the man is hurled hundreds of feet in the air and eventually lands on top of a building

madhavas sine table is the table of trigonometric sines of various angles constructed by the 14th century kerala mathematician - astronomer madhava of sangamagrama  the table lists the trigonometric sines of the twenty-four angles 375° 750° 1125°  and 9000° angles that are integral multiples of 375° ie 124 of a right angle beginning with 375 and ending with 9000 the table is encoded in the letters of devanagari using the katapayadi system  this gives the entries in the table an appearance of the verses of a poem in sanskrit  madhavas original work containing the sine table has not yet been traced the table is seen reproduced in the aryabhatiyabhashya of nilakantha somayaji 1444–1544 and also in the yuktidipikalaghuvivrti commentary of tantrasamgraha by sankara variar circa 1500-1560  the image below gives madhavas sine table in devanagari as reproduced in cultural foundations of mathematics by ck raju  the first twelve lines constitute the entries in the table the last word in the thirteenth line indicates that these are as told by madhava to understand the meaning of the values tabulated by madhava  consider some angle whose measure is a consider a circle of unit radius and center o let the arc pq of the circle subtend an angle a at the center o drop the perpendicular qr from q to op then the length of the line segment rq is the  value of the trigonometric sine of the angle a let ps be an arc of the circle whose length is equal to the length of the segment rq  for various angles a madhavas  table gives the measures of the corresponding angles pos in arcminutes  arcseconds and sixtieths of an arcsecond  as an example let a be an angle whose measure is 2250° in madhavas table the entry corresponding to 2250° is the measure in arcminutes arcseconds and sixtieths of arcseconds of the angle whose radian measure is the modern value of sin 2250° the modern numerical value of sin 2250° is 0382683432363 and and in the katapayadi system the digits are written in the reverse order thus in madhavas table the entry corresponding to 2250° is 70435131 for an angle whose measure is a  let then each of the lines in the table specifies eight digits let the digits corresponding to angle a read from left to right be then according to the rules of the katapayadi system of kerala mathematicians we have to complete the numerical computations one must have a knowledge of the value of π  it is appropriate that we use the value of π computed by madhava himself nilakantha somayaji has given this value of π in his Āryabhaṭīya -bhashya as follows  a transliteration of the last two lines vibudha-netra-gaja-ahi-hutāśana tri-guṇa-veda-bha-vāraṇa-bāhavaḥ nava-nikharva-mite vr̥tivistare paridhi-mānam idaṁ jagadur budhāḥ the various words indicate certain numbers encoded in a scheme known as the bhūtasaṃkhyā system  the meaning of the words and the numbers encoded by them beginning with the units place are detailed in the following translation of the verse 
gods vibudha  33 eyes netra  2 elephants gaja  8 snakes ahi  8 fires hutāśana  3 three tri  3 qualities guṇa  3 vedas veda  4 nakṣatras bha  27 elephants vāraṇa  8 and arms bāhavaḥ  2 - the wise say that this is the measure of the circumference when the diameter of a circle is nava-nikharva 900000000000 so the translation of the poem using the bhūtasaṃkhyā system will simply read  2827433388233 is as the wise say the circumference of a circle whose diameter is nava-nikharva 900000000000 that is divide 2827433388233 the number from the first two lines of the poem in reverse order by nava-nikharva 900000000000 to get the value of piπ this calculation yields the value π = 31415926535922 this is the value of π used by madhava in his further calculations and is accurate to 11 decimal places madhavas table lists the following digits corresponding to the angle 4500° this yields the angle with measure the value of the trigonometric sine of 4500° as given in madhavas table is substituting the value of π computed by madhava in the above expression one gets sin 45° as 070710681 this value may be compared with the modern exact value of sin 4500° namely 070710678 in table below the first column contains the list of the twenty-four angles beginning with 375 and ending with 9000 the second column contains the values tabulated by madhava in devanagari in the form in which it was given by madhava these are taken from malayalam commentary of karanapaddhati by pk koru  and are slightly different from the table given in cultural foundations of mathematics by ck raju    the third column contains iso 15919 transliterations of the lines given in the second column the digits encoded by the lines in second column are given in arabic numerals in the fourth column the values of the trigonometric sines derived from the numbers specified in madhavas table are listed in the fifth column these values are  computed using the approximate value 31415926535922 for π obtained by madhava for comparison the exact values of the trigonometric sines of the angles are given in the sixth column no work of madhava detailing the methods used by him for the computation of the sine table has survived however  from the writings of later kerala mathematicians like nilakantha somayaji  tantrasangraha  and jyeshtadeva  yuktibhāṣā  that give ample references to madhavas accomplishments it is conjectured that madhava computed his sine table using the power series  expansion of sin x

mannathara is a small village in the idukki district of kerala on the southwest coast of india  this village is located in environmentallye rich mountains of the western ghats the word manathra evolves from the name of a tribal groups called mannan  mannans were the early inhabitants of in the region this was a place with rich megalithic sites in the early twentieth century continuous human intervention in the terrain destroyed most of the historically rich sites it is therefore becoming difficult to shed light on the early history of this region but it is important to do further research on the human interaction in the pre-historic western ghats migration of the peasants in the 1950s and 1960s was the major turning point in the history of this forest hilly region into an agrarian village  now it is a village of farmers who have migrated from palai  ettumanoor  kothamangalam  thodupuzha  and melukavu  this was largely connected with the larger project to accelerate the production of cash crops in the later decades the entire high range as father vadakkan mentioned in his biography ente kuthippum kitaappum became the backbone of the kerala economy this village is famous for its high quality black pepper  black pepper and cardamon from this area had been considered as special quality in the mattacherry spice market in cochin   but the leaf disease of black pepper  kurumulku valli  in the late 1980s onwards was a major backlash to the agrarian change of mannathara  moreover the import of black pepper from other parts of the world to cochin port and mixing of the imported goods with high quality pepper from idukki affected the demand of high range pepper in the international market in the 1990s as elsewhere in india structural adjustment policies of the government affected mannathara economy as well  the roll back of the government of indian and the state government from the welfare policies for peasants and elimination of subsidy for fertilizers increased the risk of investment  the risk of investment was high in the case of ginger  plantain  and areca nut cultivation  the heavy fluctuations in the climate and various crop diseases increased the burden of the peasants  cultivation of cassava  tapioca  and rice and milk products were the ways to meet their ends  milma apcos corporation of the kerala state government was a helping hand to the peasants nursing as a profession with employment chances attracted the lower middle class peasant families  the agrarian crisis of compelled young women to prefer nursing as a profession  trained nurses mostly from syrian christian and ezhava families migrated to middle eastern countries delhi bangalore chennai now there are a few family has its members in america and england daughters of chennamkulam pappachan and the son of paulose eenthumkal are in the usa though the most of the lower-middle-class family remain unchanged in their economic condition some of the families enjoy the economic mobility 
till the beginning of the 21st century once we reach the place after a long journey a long strip of rice field was the landmark and main attraction of mannathara mannathra thodu a stream flowing in the middle of the rice field is the life line of mannathara  now the decline in the rice production due to various reasons affected the mannathara rice filed as well overflowing of this stream in the heavy monsoon months helps to balance the fertility of this rice field but the first thing we notice would be the poor transport infrastructure of this region the government had been largely ignoring the transport development of the region for decades it is only after 1995 a positive reaction is visible from the side of authorities now rajamudi-thoprumkudy main state high way and mannathara-perumthotty road are the life line of the village these two tarred roads connect mannathra with other villages and market places including kattappana murickassery cheruthony and nedumkandam and connects the region with larger market place such as thodupuzhaand kothamangalam

this article looks at the economies of manchukuo and mengjiang  in the period 1931-1945 the effective japanese annexation of 1931 led to a colonial system see manchukuo administration  japan invested in heavy industry  and to a lesser extent agriculture the general affairs state council retained japanese control of official economic policy  the central bank of manchou was the national central bank the kwantung army held the highest authority representing the emperor of japan  and the respective ministries of the nominal manchoukou central government were also involved the effective annexation gave japan an area suitable for farming  such as scarcely existed on the countrys islands or other parts generally mountainous of the empire of japan  the area was primarily agricultural in character although with some urbanization agriculture employed 85 of the population farmers produced many crops particularly on the southern plains manchu farms practiced crop rotation frequently with primitive culture methods kaoliang 70 corn and maize 70 wheat 80 and soy 35 were popular crops others in quantity were alfalfa  apples  apricots  chestnuts  col  cotton  cucumber  forage  garlic  giant radish  hemp  indigo  lupulus  millet  nuts  onions  opium poppies for opium  peaches  pears  peanuts  rice  ricine  rye  sesame  sugar beet  sweet potatoes  thyme  tobacco  and others in amur land manchu side honey 1800 tonnes was collected from kaoliang and corn liquors were made including vodka  sake  beer  soy juices and vinegar  the modern wheat and flour industry was located in harbin from russian times apart from basic mills in other areas the most intensive farming occurred in a 150–250 kilometres 93–155 mi zone extending from the liaotung gulf to the northwest in 1934 it totaled between 120000–160000 square kilometres 46000–62000 sq mi the proportions of the principal crops in 1934 were soy was manchukuos principal crop  the first exports were made in 1908 to england the economic expansion of soy is attributed in great part to the south manchurian railway company which enabled direct export from dairen abroad in particular to china and japan proper manchukuo hosted many types of processing mill 1933 to 1934 saw a reduction of more than 4000 square kilometres 1500 sq mi in cultivated extent and production fell from 4-6 million to 384 million tonnes the japanese developed industry to use soy with average production of 1500000 tonnes half was exported to europe crude oil paste for fertilizer and soybeans for food was sent to japan the rest of the plant was used in cellulose factories manchukuo regularly produced 120000 kilograms of mediocre quality the opium poppy was grown to obtain opium in november 1932 the mitsui zaibatsu conglomerate held a state monopoly for poppy farming with the declared intention of reducing its heavy local use fixed cultivation areas were set up in jehol and northwest kirin for 1934-35 cultivation area was evaluated as 480 square kilometres 190 sq mi with a yield of 11 tonneskm² there was much illegal growing and its high profitability retarded the effective suppression of this dangerous drug nikisansuke a secret japanese merchant group participated in the opium industry this group was formed by the monopoly generated profits of twenty to thirty million yen per year the military prohibited the use of opium and other narcotics by its troops punishment was loss of japanese citizenship but allowed it to be used as a demoralization weapon against inferior races a term that included all non-japanese peoples one of the participants naoki hoshino negotiated a large loan from japanese banks using a lien on the profits of manchukuos opium monopoly bureau as collateral another authority states that annual narcotics revenue in china including manchukuo was estimated by the japanese military at 300 million yen a year similar policies operated across japanese-occupied asia oxen  donkeys  heavy horses transported the harvest hsingan province worked horses and bactrian camels  and heilungkiang and kirin provinces used sled dogs to aid transport the cultivable land was estimated as 300000 square kilometres 120000 sq mi principally in the central plain -percentage total of land cultivated 52

introduction of foreign species including pigs  cattle  and sheep  which produced milk  meat  leather and wool  other interesting products were the silkworm and the wild silk or tussah tussor worm the first needed the white mulberry for food and the second needed quercus mongolica and other species of oak tree to make tussah silk both products were collected for dyeing and export to europe and america or sent as raw material to these markets the cocooned worms were sent to china and japan the production of tussah silk or pongee was in kaiping and antung liaoning province while silk worms stayed in kwantung kantoshu and south manchurian railway zone and chosen in bushels per acre except cotton in kilograms in chientao or yenki manchu district the korean colony extensively cultivated rice lumber and wood products were important industries jehol and kirin provinces held great expanses of various types of forest from 1911 to 1931 chinese lumberjacks began to work there the volume of cut wood during the manchu period was some 2500000000 cubic metres 33 × 10 9 cu yd foresting took place mostly in the yalu and sungari river areas their tributaries permitted river transport to woodworking centers in andong  kirin and harbin cities the tumen and other northern rivers also provided transport typical production before 1939 was 4000000 cubic metres 5200000 cu yd per year uses were railroad ties  cellulose paste for paper and for karafuto rayon production and export to japan russia and central and northern china  a similar pattern may have occurred in mengjiang  in the mountains many species of animals could be hunted for their skins for meat or for sport this area corresponds with the current heilongjiang province the situation is similar in mengjiang too the rivers amur  sungari  nonni  mutang-kiang  ussuri  liao  yalu and tumen  and the lakes khanka  buir-nor and hulun-nor are all important fish sources species include trout  salmon  and european perch  with the exception of buir-nor and hulun-nor these can be fished only in snow-free months the latter lakes are useful fish sources for residents in xingan province near the russian-mongolia frontier area and were a cause of frontier disputes the annual catch in rivers and lakes was 25000 tonnes sea fishing was in the po-hai gulf and yellow sea areas it included cod  shrimp  sea bream  lobster  and crab  prior to japanese intervention the sole industry was the mukden arsenal property of chang hsueh-liang son of chang tso-lin  the manchu dictator the colonial government organized and implemented two five-year plans during the 1930s reminiscent of soviet five-year plans  with the aid of naoki hoshino  industrial development had as a primary goal supplying raw material and finished products for the japanese military the first industrial centers in manchukuo were in the mukden – dairen area  industrial centers were in anshan  shakakon dairen  ryojun  fushun  fusin  and other cities manchukuo used the chosen ports of yuki seishin and rashin for the japan sea area products included aircraft automobiles and trucks blankets boots bread and flour bricks candies and foods carpets raw cellulose  cement  dyes and inks electrical devices fabric farm equipment glass industrial paint industrial paper liquor and beer locomotive manufacturing and repair and related railway industries milk and cheese mining equipment  munitions processed leather products rubber articles soy and other processed foods  vegetable oil  hand and heavy weapons etc some measures of manchu industrial production 1932–35 after deposing the japanese the soviet union sent plant and equipment to the soviet far east and siberia valued at 858000000 us dollars they took only the most modern industrial equipment laboratories hospitals etc destroying older machines they took electric power plants mining equipment machine tools and other items residential and commercial construction increased during the japanese period  the most important cities were another table mentioned this the japanese constructed 6500 kilometers 4000 mi of roads they also founded a local airline which

are 200000000 metric tonnes and lignite estimates are 50500000 metric tonnes additional deposits are in yentai private mines operated in penhsihu and hsintai other important mines are sian in liaoning province muleng in kirin province and peopiao in jehol province production during 1907–1908 remained under 2000000 tonnes in 1919–1920 extraction increased to 3700000 tonnes rising in 1924–1929 to 5540000 tonnes during 1925 the south manchurian railway company invested in opening coal deposits in chalai nor 25 kilometers 16 mi from frontier station manchouli which extracted 290000 metric tonnes by 1934 production had reached 8000000 tonnes both local use and exports increased in 1934–1936 extractions were in 1923–1924 1000000 tonnes were extracted coal production in manchukuo during 1930 exceeded 10000000 tonnes in 1941 other areas produced 20000000 tonnes with reserves of 20000000000 tonnes coal production was calculated in accord with other sources in 1932 reserves of 4500000 tonnes in 1944 estimates increased to 20000000000 tonnes the japanese built coal gasification plants for industrial uses manchukuo also exported processed or raw products to japan according to american geologist forster payne 70 of iron sources of east asia are in coastal regions of manchuria with reserves calculated in 1944 of 2000 to 2500 tonnes against 721 million of tonnes in germany such ores had 60 iron other reserves near anshan south of mukden contain a median 40 iron content 1931–1932 production was 1000000 tonnes from deposits in taku shan near anshan liaoning in the shan pai shang mountains in miaoerkow and tungpientao and in liaoning in 1933 the total production of iron in the anshan and penhsihu factories was 430000 tonnes in 1934 950000 tonnes of low-grade hematite was first produced the miaoerkow mine also produced 235000 tonnes of hematite in the tungpientao deposits the reserves are 100000000 tonnes of high-grade iron the anshan factories in 1941 produced 1750000 iron tonnes and 1000000 steel tonnes in 1942 production increased to 3600000 tonnes and penhsihu produced 500000 tonnes in addition the tungpientao factory had the capacity to produce 800000 tonnes alternatively the special report of geological survey of china 1945 mentioned that the japanese extraction of iron in manchuria and occupied china grew from 101000 tonnes to 175000 tonnes or by 73 manchukuo received from japan scrap iron for iron and steel processing and at the same time exported unfinished steel products manchukuo has little petroleum except at fushum and fusin where there were extensive deposits of oil-rich slate  oil shale and shist  fushun produced 1000000 tonnes in 1941 in jehol some oil was extracted in conjunction with coal deposits manchukuo also operated oil refineries  the principal sources of bauxite in manchukuo are alunite deposits in liaoning  bauxite and alunite in yentai penshiu ninshintai saoshin reserves were estimated at 25300000 tonnes with metallic content of 55  later another 120000000 tonnes was discovered in 1932 the mantetsu south manchurian railway company and anshan iron steel works organized laboratories in fushun and tokyo to develop processes to exploit these sources in 1936-38 they founded the manchu society for light metals the refining process used electricity from fushun coal hydrochloric acid  potassium chloride and iron silica  during 1938-42 aluminum production increased from 5000 to 30000 tonnes in 1936 copper production 1936 reached 100 tonnes growing in 1943 to 500 tones lead production was 1223 tonnes zinc extraction was 398 tonnes magnesite mines northwest of tsichiao and nuishishan opened in 1913 with estimated reserves of 13600000000 tonnes these sources became exploitable with the 100 kilometers 62 mi extension of the antung-mukden railway in 1941 three installation processed the ore producing 24 of world output  hydroelectric power provided the majority of electricity during the period the japanese invested in power plants on the sungari and yalu rivers they protected plants in the nonni and liao rivers during the august 1945 soviet invasion other electricity sources included gas oil bunker oil and coal in 1925 grain exports comprised 88 and lumber the remainder in 1929 there was a slump in soy sales to the united states and germany became the principal buyer in 1933 the manchu exterior commerce a japanese monopoly recorded that exports exceeded imports coal represented 10 and iron a greater amount minor exports were other farming products pigs mice kaoliang  peanuts imports were cotton flour of various grains iron and unfinished and manufactured products for industry the principal commerce was with china and japan with some exports going to russia other export tables from 1923 indicated output of 4423000 tonnes 50 soy and 30 coal in 1939 foreign trade rose to 2650840000 million manchukuo yuan japan ranked first but other trading partners included the united states china and germany in 1931 the total production of natural resources inside the japanese empire was ¥283000000 foreign purchases totaled ¥220000000 which represented 40 of consumption however their local production was evaluated as ¥746000000 vs imports of ¥660000000 so local production represented 61 of the total japanese investment led manchukuos emergence as the third-largest industrial area in east asia after japan-proper and the ussr  at manchukuo other foreign businessmen mentioned how japanchukuo controlled all manchukuoan industry with japanese filling all important technical and administrative roles japanese investment private and central government ran at ¥1715000000 £171580000 sterling  in 1938 in 1941 ¥5000000000 was reinvested—the equivalent of 2 for every person in china for local and foreign commerce  japan organized a centralized economic structure  a national central bank and a local currency the yuan of manchukuo  during the early years of japanese control manchukuo represented 143 of total industrial production in china including 12 of its industrial work force from 1913 to 1930 farm production grew by 70 its railways represented 30 of all chinese railways during 1937 the japanese government with the japanese army commissioned industrialist yoshisuke aikawa to organize and direct the manchuria industrial development company with a capital of 758000000 yen this became the manchoukuoan zaibatsu empire and guided in centralizing mining and heavy industry the japanese invested ¥440000000 £44000000 one-half to two-thirds of the investment was reserved for soy products investments were made in the dowa automobile company for the manufacture of cars and trucks manshukoku hikoki seizo kk for making engines and aircraft in harbin jintan candy

investments in land as 11000000000 yen from 1932 the japanese increased their private and government investments in other industrial sectors nippon lurgi goshi kk of tokyo the japanese lurgi office in tokyo using industrial licenses of metallgesellschaft-lurgi frankfurt am main ag of germany installed the following industrial plants in manchukuo the japanese company mentioned above decided during the war to install a similar factory in china to process the coal of the mengchiang and hopei areas in 1943 the japanese began the construction a 200 kilometers 120 mi river channel to ease navigation from mukden-anshan-sinku sing-kow to the chili gulf  a second goal was to regulate the flow of liao-ho river on the left side of fushun en route to mukden this project permitted easy access for merchant vessels to the heart of the manchukuan industrial district at the same time japanese planned the construction of power plants in sungari and other rivers for magnesium refining and other developments before 1932 the economic situation was chaotic but the establishment of the yuan of manchukuo as the local monetary unit in parity with the japanese yen  and establishment of the central bank of manchou as the central bank institution produced a relatively stable business climate

  the answers at the end  is a song by english musician george harrison  released in 1975 on his final album for apple records  extra texture read all about it  part of the song lyrics came from a wall inscription at harrisons nineteenth-century home friar park  a legacy of the propertys original owner sir frank crisp  this aphorism  beginning scan not a friend with a microscopic glass had resonated with harrison since he bought the property in 1970 and it was a quote he frequently used when discussing his difficult relationship with fellow ex- beatle paul mccartney  harrisons adaptation of the verse for the answers at the end coincided with a period of personal upheaval related to the harsh criticism that his 1974 north american tour had received from a number of influential concert reviewers the songs plea for tolerance recalls harrisons 1970 hit song  isnt it a pity  and in part of its musical arrangement the answers at the end bears the influence of nina simone s 1972 cover version of that earlier composition like much of the extra texture album the song has traditionally enjoyed a mixed reception from music critics and biographers – being labelled archaic parlour poetry  and a bleak assessment of the human condition  on one hand and a gorgeously melodic song of forgiveness  on the other the backing musicians on the recording include members of the band attitudes  among them david foster and jim keltner  who were signed to harrisons dark horse record label at the time in march 1970 george harrison and his first wife pattie boyd  moved into their victorian gothic residence at friar park in henley-on-thames  oxfordshire  the 120-room house was built in the 1890s  on the site of a thirteenth-century friary by frank crisp  a city of london solicitor and microscopist   harrison was immediately taken with crisps penchant for whimsy  the legacies of which included interior features such as doorknobs and light switches shaped as monks faces which meant tweaking a nose in order to turn each light on  and a carving of a monks head that showed him smiling on one side and frowning on the other  a keen horticulturalist and an authority on medieval gardening   crisp established 10 acres of formal gardens  which similarly reflected his eccentric tastes   nb 1  from midway through the twentieth century until 1969 ownership of friar park resided with the roman catholic church    as a result paint masked some of crisps inscriptions inside the house  but outside signs reading dont keep off the grass  herons will be prosecuted and  eton boys are a harrowing sight remained intact   nb 2  harrison also discovered inscriptions with a more profound meaning which he described to his hare krishna friend shyamasundar das as like songs really about the devil about friendship life  one example was shadows we are and shadows we depart written on a stone sundial  another began scan not a friend with a microscopic glass  you know his faults now let his foibles pass   this four-line verse was written on a wall above friar parks entrance hall  and it was an aphorism that harrison soon took to quoting in interviews  on 28 april 1970 just over two weeks after the beatles break-up  he used the words during an interview for new yorks wplq radio  as village voice reporter howard smith repeatedly pushed for details on the animosity between paul mccartney and the other three beatles  in october 1974 – after what harrison termed a bad domestic year following his split with boyd  and shortly before his troubled north american tour with ravi shankar  – he used the same quote in an interview with bbc radio s alan freeman   when again discussing the current relationship among the four ex-beatles    nb 3  harrison wrote his first friar park-inspired composition  ballad of sir frankie crisp let it roll  within two months of moving in  as with the crispisms that surfaced in the lyrics to his 1974 single  ding dong ding dong   a number of years elapsed before he incorporated the scan not a friend inscription into a song  by 1975 it provided the central theme to the answers at the end   a composition that theologian dale allison has written expresses the personal doubts and religious uncertainty george experienced in the mid-1970s  this short-lived uncertainty contrasted with his previous devotion to a hinduism -aligned spiritual path allison notes  and it was a period marked by harrisons excessive use of alcohol and cocaine  – a symptom of his despondency following the 1974 tour and the derision afforded his dark horse album   according to the way he renders crisps inscription in his 1980 autobiography i me mine  harrison made a minor rewording to the original texts third line life is one long enigma true my friend for his opening verse to the answers at the end  scan not a friend with a microscopic glass you know his faults now let his foibles pass life is one long enigma my friend so read on read on the answers at the end there were disasters all around at that time  but the thing about sir frank with his advice like scan not a friend with a microscopic glass  i mean that helped me actively to ease up on whomsoever i thought i loved gave me that consciousness not to hang on to the negative side of it to be more forgiving  in another passage from i me mine  read out by his son dhani in the 2011 documentary george harrison living in the material world   harrison explains that these words helped him reach a better understanding of human relationships and others around him  the theme of tolerance is further reflected in the songs chorus  in which harrison urges  dont be so hard on the ones that you love  its the ones that you love we think so little of   the chorus lyrics echo the message of harrisons all things must pass composition  isnt it a pity   in this case providing a bleak assessment of the human condition author ian inglis writes  the second verse begins with an example of what author alan clayson views as the restricted code found in harrisons lyrics on much of the extra texture album  the speech of flowers excels the flowers of speech but whats often in your heart is the hardest thing to reach and life is one long mystery my friend so live on live on the answers at the end allison writes that in line 2 of this verse harrison is surely talking about his inability to find god who for him dwells above all inside the human being  with harrison describing life as first an  enigma  and then a  mystery  allison suggests the previous certainties of the singers faith have disappeared true to the song title only death will reveal  whether his religious beliefs have been true or false  as a further reference to the sentiment regarding friendship expressed in isnt it a pity  the middle section of the answers at the end shows the influence of nina simone s 1972 cover of that earlier song   according to his recollection in i me mine  harrison added this section or coda  only when recording the answers at the end  in the lyrics  and isnt it a pity how  we hurt the ones we love the most of all   inglis notes the influence of the 1944 pop standard  you always hurt the one you love   in the final half-verse following a brief instrumental passage harrison personalises the second line of crisps text to  you know my faults now let my foibles pass   author robert rodriguez observes that the subject of reserving judgement would have resonated with harrison at this time given the shellacking he had recently received in music publications such as rolling stone   among harrisons biographers interpretations differ regarding the message of extra texture songs such as the answers at the end in relation to his spirituality like dale allison gary tillery writes of extra texture revealing harrisons inner turmoil at having strayed from his faith  simon leng views this song as a deliberate tempering of tone rather than a change in fundamental beliefs however with its choruses attenuating the search for universal solutions to a simpler earthbound observation  joshua greene writes that harrison had regained strength and relaxed his missionary zeal in 1975 greene uses the answers at the end to support his claim that gone were exhortations to chant and warnings about rebirth in the material world in harrisons song lyrics instead replaced by a modest appeal for tolerance  harrison taped the basic track for the answers at the end at am studios in los angeles on 22 april 1975  music writers have commented on the rushed and expedient nature of these sessions for extra texture    an album that saw out harrisons commitments to emi -affiliated apple records and allowed him to sign with his own am -distributed label dark horse records    rather than use his studio at friar park fpshot  harrison recorded the album at a facility he admitted to finding technically limiting  since he was in los angeles overseeing projects by his various dark horse acts when studio time became available following the cancellation of sessions for splinter s second album  another of these acts was attitudes   a band put together by his friend session drummer jim keltner   the timing was perfect leng writes of harrisons approach to making extra texture  as this latest signing to dark horse provided a ready-made backup band close at hand  although attitudes guitarist danny kortchmar did not play on the album the answers at the end was one of two songs that featured all three of the other band members  keltner pianistmusical arranger david foster and bassistlead singer paul stallworth   nb 4  another guest musician on the recording was keyboard player gary wright   a regular contributor to harrisons solo work throughout the 1970s and soon to enjoy a career breakthrough with his dream weaver album 1975  am engineer norman kinney who had carried out the mix down for the concert for bangladesh recordings four years before  added tambourine to the song  a ballad set to what leng describes as a mellow reflective soul mood like much of its parent album  the answers at the end is dominated by fosters piano  the song also features harrisons most complete range of guitar parts on the keyboard-heavy extra texture album  harrison played 12-string acoustic guitar on the main session before adding electric guitar arpeggios over the songs choruses and a brief bottleneck solo during the 31 may–6 june overdubbing sessions  unlike the delectable collage found on much of his previous work  all his guitar parts on the album would be mixed low in the end result  over the  isnt it a pity how   coda leng writes harrison semi- scats  the words  gospel style over sundown jazz piano  – a vocal affectation that reflected his immersion in the soul music genre  the short instrumental break follows this before the choruses repeat growing in intensity each time as harrisons vocals become more impassioned  the song ends with what leng calls a second smoochy coda  a string arrangement arranged and conducted by foster was overdubbed on 6 june at am  over the two codas where author elliot huntley notes the merest veneer of the strings accompanying harrisons vocal  this orchestral part incorporates aspects of the string arrangement on john lennon s recent hit song  9 dream  which in turn had been inspired by john barham s score for  try some buy some   co-produced by harrison and phil spector in 1971  the answers at the end was released in september 1975 as the second track on extra texture read all about it   music critics immediately lambasted the song for its funereal tempo  which was all the more obvious after the propulsive and rocking  album opener  you   dave marsh of rolling stone referred to the answers at the end as padded subterfuge which could easily have been cut down to two minutes from its length of 532  writing 21 years later alan clayson likewise dismissed the track calling it archaic parlour poetry on an album full of long dull melodies  simon leng admires the warm sonic scenes of the answers at the end and recognises it as an interesting composition one that ponders the nature of relationships in a similar way to bob dylan s 1975 album blood on the tracks   leng groups the song with another extra texture track  grey cloudy lies  however as two slabs of introspection that suffer from being part calls for tolerance and part expression of downright despair  the old bold george is no more leng laments of the answers at the end the certainties of  the lord loves the one  seem to have dissipated  the passionate searcher of  hear me lord  sounds defeated asking for a little live and let live  while similarly noting the bleakness of the subject matter inglis opines the lack of optimism in his words is matched by a largely inconspicuous melody and an inconsistent production in which alternate piano strings and guitar interludes fail to provide a coherent musical context  the answers at the end has its admirers with eight arms to hold you authors chip madinger and mark easter labelling it a highlight of the album  and elliot huntley recognising it as a gorgeously melodic song of forgiveness  huntley praises the tracks epic sweep and writes of the simone-inspired coda this is one of my favourite moments of the entire harrison back-catalogue especially when the ensemble returns to see the song through to its conclusion   allmusic s richard ginell describes the answers at the end as one of harrisons most beautifully harmonized majestic strangely underrated ballads  along with the extra texture tracks you and  this guitar cant keep from crying  ginell rates the song among the best from harrisons solo career  in his book covering the beatles first decade as solo artists fab four faq 20  robert rodriguez includes the answers at the end in the chapter the best unsung george which lists eight overlooked harrison compositions and notes the songs grace and majesty reminiscent of isnt it a pity

great kneighton is the marketing name chosen by countryside properties for a major new housing development to the south of cambridge on the clay farm and glebe farm sites in the trumpington ward of the city together with the trumpington meadows development south-west of trumpington it forms part of the southern fringe expansion of the city the choice of the name great kneighton provoked some controversy    historically the name great kneighton had been used for a part of trumpington parish somewhat further to the east now within the grounds of addenbrookes hospital  and in addition the proposed name was interpreted as aiming to give the new development a separate identity whereas local aspirations were rather that the incoming community would be drawn into an enlarged trumpington 280 new homes are being built on the glebe farm site south of shelford road  these are mainly apartments  forty per cent of the homes will be‘affordable homes’ a mixture of rental and intermediate housing provided by cambridgeshire partnerships limited  the first residents arrived in late 2012  north of shelford road on the clay farm site 2300 homes are to be built along with a new secondary school trumpington community college to open in 201516  allotments and a 120-acre country park   a new neighbourhood centre for trumpington as a whole will host library provision community facilities medical facilities retail space youth facilities as well as office space for the police and social services  again forty per cent of the homes will be ‘affordable homes’  as well as providing the allotments an adventure playground and sports facilities for the planned secondary school the new park will provide the local community with extensive woodlands a bird reserve areas of wetland with balancing ponds and sustainable urban drainage systems used for harvesting rainwater  all will contribute to the sites biodiversity  planting has started on the southern half of the country park and will include over 13000 new trees and bushes the developments environmentally-friendly credentials extend to encouraging greener modes of transport too as well as protecting and enhancing the existing natural habitat  it offers easily accessible cycle stores cycleways and footpaths  there are good public transport links provided by the guided busway which provides services to addenbrookes and to the city centre prior to the commencement of construction oxford archaeology east undertook archaeological excavations the 20 hectare site represented the largest single archaeological excavation ever to have been undertaken in the cambridge area  the team found evidence of activity from the early neolithic c 4000bc up to the present with the bulk of the archaeology dating from the middle bronze age to and late iron age -early roman periods  initially laid out around 1500 bc the system of middle bronze age rectilinear fields and enclosures covered more than half the excavation area though there was a noticeable absence at the centre of the site the enclosures may have been for cattle which would have been a valuable resource that needed to be retained and protected from wild animals and rustlers the enclosures were about 60–90 m x 50 m bounded by large deep ditches the large and highly significant finds assemblage included large quantities of shell-tempered deverel-rimbury pottery flint-tempered finewares animal bone bone needles a bronze spearhead flint arrowheads land large numbers of heated sandstones
the form of the late iron age occupation was very different – small fields and paddocks bounded by shallower and narrower ditches no posthole structures were recorded but the quantity of artefacts indicated direct occupation in parts in the late iron age there was a high-status burial near the western edge of the development close to the present cambridge professional development centre site this has been dated to c 35-40ad and included two bodies which had been cremated they were accompanied by grave goods from overseas including pottery vessels and a fine toiletry set the settlement continued into the early roman period before the area was  abandoned probably before the end of the 2nd century however one of the most puzzling features on the site a double ditched sub-circular ‘monument’ partially lying beyond the southwest edge of excavation dated from a later period the remains of at least three individuals five late roman bracelets and a group of large iron nails with butchered cattle remains interspersed were recovered from high up in the inner ditch suggesting a funerary function for the feature some abraded late roman pottery was also recovered the human remains appear to have been redeposited perhaps from a nearby cemetery in the very late or even post-roman period

western marxism is a body of various marxist theoreticians based in western and central europe  in contrast with philosophy in the soviet union  while györgy lukács s history and class consciousness  and karl korsch s marxism and philosophy   first published in 1923 are often seen as the works that inaugurated this current the phrase itself was coined much later by maurice merleau-ponty   antonio gramsci is also of great significance though many of his writings were not translated into english until comparatively late western marxists have commonly but not exclusively worked as professional academics  philosophers  sociologists  political scientists  literary critics  and so on although there have been many schools of marxist thought that are sharply distinguished from marxism-leninism - such as austromarxism or the left communism of antonie pannekoek or rosa luxemburg - those theorists who downplay the primacy of economic analysis are considered western marxists as they concern themselves instead with abstract and philosophical areas of marxism in its earliest years western marxisms most characteristic element was a stress on the hegelian and humanist components of karl marxs thought but later forms of western marxism such as structural marxism  have been just as strongly antihumanist  western marxism often emphasises the importance of the study of culture for an adequate marxist understanding of society western marxists have thus elaborated often-complex variations on the theories of ideology and superstructure  which are only thinly sketched in the writings of marx and engels themselves usually seen as a separate current of thought cultural studies developed by british academics in the 1960s shares much common ground with western marxism the work of theorists such as raymond williams addresses issue of culture that were dismissed by previous marxists as unimportant the theories of antonio gramsci and the frankfurt school are important source points for british cultural studies western marxists have varied in terms of political commitment lukács gramsci and althusser were all members of soviet -aligned parties karl korsch was heavily critical of soviet marxism advocating council communism and later becoming increasingly interested in anarchism the theorists of the frankfurt school tended towards political quietism although herbert marcuse became known as the father of the new left  sartre  merleau-ponty and lefebvre were at different periods supporters of the communist party of france  but all would later become disillusioned with it ernst bloch lived in and supported the soviet union  but lost faith in it towards the end of his life maoism and trotskyism also influenced western marxism

his ma in 1616 and was made a knight of the bath  meaning he was now sir algernon percy   in 1618 algernon and his tutor edward douse began a six-year tour of continental europe visiting the netherlands  italy  and france   algernon returned to england in 1624 and joined his father recently released from the tower at court  algernons first public service involved serving as mp for sussex during the happy parliament of 1624–25 and as mp for chichester during the useless parliament of 1625–26  in march 1626 algernon was summoned to the house of lords  assuming his fathers barony and becoming known as  lord percy   in november 1626 he was appointed joint lord lieutenant of cumberland  westmorland  and northumberland   percy became a leader in the house of lords of the faction opposed to charles i s favourite george villiers 1st duke of buckingham   in 1629 algernon married anne cecil daughter of william cecil 2nd earl of salisbury  in spite of his fathers deep disapproval who said that the blood of a percy would not mix with the blood of a cecil if you poured it on a dish percy family history  the 9th earl blamed the 1st earl of salisbury for his imprisonment in the tower   the marriage however produced five daughters  including anne d1654 who married philip stanhope 2nd earl of chesterfield  no issue and elizabeth 1636–1718 who married arthur capell 1st earl of essex  upon the death of the 9th earl in 1632 algernon percy became the 10th earl of northumberland  throughout the early 1630s the 10th earl attempted to ingratiate himself with charles is court initially unsuccessfully although his family connections in the queens household did manage to get him admitted to the order of the garter in 1635  by 1636–37 he was in good enough standing at court to be appointed admiral of the ship money fleet  northumberland attempted to initiate naval reforms often bypassing the lords of the admiralty and submitting his proposals directly to charles i and the privy council   although most historians would not consider northumberland a puritan  he did enforce the oath of supremacy on his fleet and removed three catholic officers who refused to take the oath  northumberlands first expedition as admiral in 1636 was to force dutch ships fishing in waters claimed by england to purchase english fishing licenses in exchange for which the english fleet would offer protection from the dunkirkers   if dutch sea captains refused to purchase the licenses their nets were cut  northumberland was less enthusiastic about his second expedition as admiral which was to transport spanish money to the netherlands in 1637  northumberlands political faction was strongly pro-french and anti-spanish so he rankled at the thought of aiding the spaniards  in 1638 two of northumberlands prominent supporters at court — thomas wentworth and archbishop of canterbury william laud — used their influence at court to have northumberland made lord high admiral of england  a position which had been vacant since the assassination of the 1st duke of buckingham in 1628  at the time he was appointed it was understood that charles is son james would become lord high admiral upon attaining his majority although the civil wars occurred before this could happen and charles removed northumberland from the post in 1642  in response to the rise of the scottish covenanters  who opposed the attempt to introduce the book of common prayer in scotland in 1637 charles i appointed an eight-man subcommittee of the privy council to deal with the issue  northumberlands patron thomas wentworth favoured war with scotland while northumberland did not want to go to war and feared that his estates in northern england would be occupied during the hostilities  as such when wentworth had northumberland appointed general of the english forces during the second of the bishops wars in january 1640 northumberland was happy to let illness prevent him from joining the army in the field and northumberland was entirely defeatist about the prospect of defeating the covenanters militarily  in may 1640 northumberland was one of only two members of a subcommittee of the privy council who opposed the dissolution of the short parliament  a move that confirmed his break with wentworth whom charles had recently named earl of strafford and earned him the displeasure of the king  when the long parliament met northumberland became one of the leading critics of royal policy  during straffords trial for high treason and the subsequent bill of attainder against him northumberland gave evidence at his trial which though favourable on the important point of bringing the irish army to england was on the whole damaging  northumberlands brother henry was involved in the first army plot of 1641 an attempt to rescue strafford from the tower of london and to forcibly dissolve the long parliament  northumberland encouraged his brother to write a letter exposing the royalist plot to rescue strafford and then at john pym s urging agreed to allow denzil holles and john hampden to publish this letter  with the coming of the english civil war  northumberland became the highest-ranking member of charles is government to side with the parliamentarians   his first action in open defiance of royal authority came in november 1641 when he obeyed parliament s instruction to prepare four ships to take men and arms under parliamentary control to ireland to suppress the rebellion there  he did not however support the grand remonstrance   however when james stewart 1st duke of richmond suggested in january 1642 that the parliament adjourn for six months northumberland led a protest which favoured sanctioning richmond for breach of privilege  in february parliament named northumberland lord lieutenant of sussex  pembrokeshire  and anglesey   northumberland subsequently voted in favour of the militia ordinance   during the subsequent fighting between royalist and parliamentary forces northumberlands control of the navy was a crucial factor in securing parliamentary victory  as a result charles i removed northumberland from the post of lord high admiral in late june 1642 and northumberland relinquished the position  in july he accepted a position on the parliamentary committee of public safety   northumberlands support for the war wavered shortly thereafter however in the wake of setbacks faced by parliamentary forces in 1642–43  northumberland was also disappointed that parliament chose robert rich 2nd earl of warwick rather than himself as the new lord high admiral  northumberland was apparently appalled by the violence of the battle of edgehill and the battle of turnham green  and became the leader of a party favouring peace by early-to-mid-1643  northumberlands first wife died of smallpox in 1637  in october 1642 he remarried to lady elizabeth daughter of theophilus howard 2nd earl of suffolk and thus his first wifes cousin  in april 1643 northumberland headed the parliamentary delegation to negotiate with charles i at oxford  but charles was willing to grant little  returning to london northumberlands peace party was increasingly attacked by the party favouring continued war for example in june northumberland was accused of complicity in wallers plot  though he was never prosecuted  in august a leading hawk isaac penington  the lord mayor of london instigated a plot whereby a number of lords were physically threatened in the hopes that he would be able to have northumberland arrested  after northumberland was unable to convince his cousin robert devereux 3rd earl of essex to support further peace negotiations with the royalists he retired to his estates at petworth unlike other peace lords who joined the king at oxford at this time  northumberland did not remain at petworth for long though  although he had opposed an alliance between parliament and scotland against the king following the passage of the solemn league and covenant in september 1643 northumberland returned to the capital and took the covenant  he was soon appointed to the newly created committee of both kingdoms  serving as its first chairman  northumberland would gain a reputation as a supporter of the scots on the committee — many speculated that this was because scottish forces were occupying his lands in the north  thus although he continued to favour negotiations with charles i northumberland was quickly coming around to the war partys position  northumberland was one of only four lords to vote in favour of the self-denying ordinance   soon northumberland would prove to be one of the greatest supporters of the new model army  with northumberlands servant robert scawen chairing parliaments army committee  in march 1645 parliament made northumberland guardian of charles two young children princess elizabeth and the duke of gloucester and also the duke of york in july 1646 and there was talk that northumberland might be made king if negotiations with charles failed  following the failure of the negotiations at uxbridge  northumberland was thoroughly behind the war party now known as the independents   in spite of northumberlands political conversion he did not vote in favour of the bill of attainder against his old patron archbishop laud  in early 1647 northumberland sided with edward montagu 2nd earl of manchester and the presbyterian party against the independents as they attempted to draw up terms acceptable to the king  in the emerging dispute between parliament and the army northumberland sided with the army and in july 1647 northumberland was one of nine peers who left parliament for the army following riots around westminster  meetings were subsequently held between northumberland and the army at northumberlands property syon house   northumberland led a final attempt to negotiate with charles i in december 1647 but this failed  following the second english civil war  most parliamentarians became increasingly disillusioned with charles i and began to favour his execution  northumberland attempted to halt this movement opposing the vote of no addresses in january 1648 and attempting to negotiate terms with the king at newport until the end of 1648  northumberland would prove to be one of charles is greatest supporters in the rump parliament   when parliament moved to try charles i for treason in january 1649 northumberland was the leader of the forces in the house of lords opposed to trying the king  northumberland withdrew from public life following the execution of charles i  in may 1649 he was relieved of responsibility for the kings children and no longer had any official duties  northumberland was briefly placed under house arrest in 1655 after john thurloe accused him of encouraging his northern tenants to participate in the penruddock uprising   northumberland refused requests from both oliver cromwell and richard cromwell to sit in the upper house of their parliaments  with the coming of the restoration in 1660 northumberland attempted to re-enter politics by organizing the suffolk house cabal which included edward montagu 2nd earl of manchester  denzil holles  oliver st john  and william pierrepont  and which hoped to force on charles ii the terms offered to charles i at newport  this cabal collapsed when general monck chose to support the convention parliament in april 1660  with charles iis return to england in may 1660 northumberland rushed to curry favour with the new king  he did however oppose the bill to execute the regicides responsible for charles is death  charles ii appointed northumberland to his privy council in late may 1660 and northumberland was named lord lieutenant of sussex in august and lord lieutenant of northumberland in september  his return to politics was completed with his service as lord high constable of england at charles iis coronation in april 1661  northumberland gained a reputation as a diligent enforcer of the clarendon code and as an efficient organizer of the militias  during the period of restoration politics northumberlands closest ally at court was edward montagu 2nd earl of manchester  while edward hyde 1st earl of clarendon remained a constant enemy a rivalry which climaxed with northumberland voting in favour of clarendons impeachment in 1667  northumberland died at petworth on 13 october 1668 and was buried there in september 1668  his son joceline succeeded him as 11th earl of northumberland

the zöllner illusion is a classic optical illusion named after its discoverer german astrophysicist johann karl friedrich zöllner  in 1860 zöllner sent his discovery in a letter to physicist and scholar johann christian poggendorff  editor of annalen der physik und chemie  who subsequently discovered the related poggendorff illusion  in the original drawing  table viii figure 4  of zöllner  in this figure the black lines seem to be unparallel but in reality they are parallel the shorter lines are on an angle to the longer lines this angle helps to create the impression that one end of the longer lines is nearer to the viewer than the other end this is very similar to the way the wundt illusion appears it may be that the zöllner illusion is caused by this impression of depth if the illusion is printed in green on a red background and the red and green are equally bright the illusion disappears this illusion is similar to the hering illusion  the poggendorff illusion and the müller-lyer illusion  all these illusions demonstrate how lines can seem to be distorted by their background

during the graduation lorelai tells her mother that she will still continue their friday night dinners even if rory is away the show ends implying lorelai was in a relationship with luke danes as she kisses him at rorys farewell party she had to have everything the role required someone who could act who could make you cry who could break your heart who was funny and gorgeous and tough and sexy and vulnerable we looked and looked and couldnt find that actress just about the time i was saying lets just find somebody whos pretty and put her in the corner in walks lauren she gave us everything we wanted - a lovely little gift combo before landing the role of lorelai in gilmore girls  lauren graham starred in many short-lived tv shows and guest appeared in a number of top 10 prime-time comedies  she once lived for two years on the money she made from a tv commercial for cascade  she finally landed the role in gilmore girls because she had all the characteristics producer amy sherman-palladino was looking for the fact that you had someone that talented running around hollywood not found yet was the biggest coup in the world she said because lorelais a hard fucking part youve got to be funny youve got to talk really fucking fast youve got to be able to act youve got to be sexy but not scary sexy youve got to be strong but not like i hate men its a lot that goes into this character and it was really a tough find and to find it and be able to feel like you broke somebody fresh even though everybody in town knew lauren like everybody here was like when is lauren going to get something great but america didnt know lauren and that was a real coup for us  virginia heffernan of the new york times described lorelai and rory as unsentimental brainiacs who if they could see gilmore girls  would hate its sentimentality of the last and final season also the character talks fast and uses words to keep her loneliness at bay which while opinion seems to be a relatively insightful view of her lorelai feels that to swoon even once would make her lose her verbal power and her reason for being  on the characteristic of talking fast sherman-palladino noted just by listening to lorelais vocal patterns it says volumes about this woman first of all that shes bright enough to put that many words together that quickly and it says a lot about her emotionally that shes got a deflection shield thats sort of the way she gets through the world which says survivor  she also said of the character lorelais humor was her guard and her deflection and what kept her strong it was her wonder woman cuffs  in the fifth season lorelai started a relationship with luke danes sherman-palladino commented i thought we had enough time invested in the relationship that people would care we had a good four years and in those four years we saw luke go through relationships and we saw lorelai go through three relationships i felt like it was time  lorelai is witty and quirky a coffee addict she spends a lot of time in lukes diner chatting with the locals of stars hollow she makes many pop culture references many from the 80s lorelai speaks very fast especially when upset a smart businesswoman she forms strong relationships with her employees making her business run smoothly her best friend is sookie st james  much to her parents horror she is a democrat  she drives a jeep wrangler  willa paskin of popmatters wrote lorelai is perhaps the most fully developed female character on television  the new york times tv columnist virginia heffernan said the character was painful and surprising and exciting to watch — a marvelous high-wire act  according to michael ausiello  fans were reluctant to let luke and lorelai go  in 2005 in honor of mothers day

agmatidine 2-agmatinylcytidine symbol c  or agm 2 c is a modified cytidine present in the wobble position of the anticodon of several archaeal aua decoding trnas  agmatidine is essential for correct decoding of the aua codon in many archaea and is required for aminoacylation of trna ile 2 with isoleucine the genetic code describes how triplet codons on mrna are translated into protein sequences by specific trna molecules which can base-pair with the codons precise decoding of the genetic code is a fundamental pre-requisite for long term survival of all organisms the nature of the anticodon decides the specificity of hydrogen bonding and hence the accuracy of decoding by trnas till date a variety of post-transcriptional modifications have been discovered which aid trnas in increasing their repertoire of hydrogen bonding capacities these modifications usually occur on the first base on the anticodon position 34 or the wobble base position which base pairs with the third base on the codon and are critical in specific recognition of codons by trnas the wobble rules of crick propose how a limited set of trnas can decode a wider set of codons by use of wobble base pairing these rules have been successful in explaining how most of the genetic code is specifically translated by a limited number of trnas for example a single phenylalanine trna with g in the first anticodon position can base pair with either u or c thus decoding uuu and uuc and a single leucine trna with a modified u 2-thiou in the anticodon can base pair with either a or g thus decoding uua and uug the mechanism of decoding in the box containing auu auc aua all coding for isoleucine  and aug coding for methionine  has remained a puzzle for scientists since long auu and auc are decoded by a single isoleucine trna trna ile 1  which has g in the anticodon while aua is decoded by a separate trna trna ile 2  how the second isoleucine trna decodes aua without also decoding aug has been a subject of much interest over the years different classes of organisms solve the problem of aua decoding differently for example in eukaryotes a trna having inosine at position 34 iau anticodon can decode all three isoleucine codons while a trna having pseudouridine in the anticodon ψaψ anticodon can specifically read the aua codon in eubacteria a trna having lysidine in the anticodon lau can specifically decode aua but not aug however the mechanism by which archaea solve the problem of aua decoding was not known till early 2010 when two groups simultaneously published reports that archaeal trna ile 2 contains a modified cytidine at position 34 which was named agmatidine agmatidine is similar to lysidine in that the c2-oxo group of cytidine is replaced with a basic aminoacid agmatine decarboxy arginine instead of lysine in the case of lysidine the modification is carried out by the enzyme trna ile 2 2-agmatinylcytidine synthetase a product of the gene tias present in many archaeal members  agmatidine is generated in the cell by attachment of agmatine decarboxy arginine to the c2-oxo group of cytidine by tias agmatine in turn is a decarboxylation product of arginine an aminoacid present in all cells agmatidine formation occurs though a three step mechanism in step one tias hydrolyzes the α-β phosphodiester bond of atp to produce amp and ppi in step two the c2 carbonyl oxygen of c34 attacks the γ-phosphorus atom to form the p-c34 intermediate releasing β-pi this is in contrast to the mechanism of lysidine formation where the c2-oxo group is activated by adenylation instead of phosphorylation in step three the primary amino group of agmatine attacks the c2 carbon of the p-c34 intermediate to release γ-pi and form agm 2 c tias also autophosphorylates its thr18 with the γ-phosphate of atp releasing amp and β-pi this is known to be important for agm 2 c formation although its exact role is not clear conjugation of agmatine moiety at the c2 carbon of c34 induces a tautomeric conversion of c34 which alters its hydrogen bonding pattern enabling it to pair with adenosine instead of guanosine  the modification is essential for decoding of aua codons and a trna without the modification is not aminoacylated with isoleucine moreover it has been shown that agmatine is an essential metabolite for the viability of thermococcus kodakaraensis all of the currently sequenced euryarchaeal and crenarchaeal genomes contain only one annotated isoleucine trna and three trnas with the cau anticodon annotated as methionine trnas therefore it is very likely that all members of nanoarchaea and korarchaea use agmatidine modification to selectively read aua codons however currently sequenced genomes from nanoarchaea and korarchaea contain two isoleucone trnas one of which has uau anticodon which is probably converted into ψaψ in-vivo  therefore it is thought that these classes of archaea follow a eukaryote-like strategy to solve the aua decoding problem

castgate was an attempt from the etro-tele research group at the vrije universiteit brussel to break the chicken and egg problem of ip multicast adoption on the internet   although multicast would have allowed an internet user to receive rich media and other content without placing a high burden on the net it was still unavailable to most internet users the castgate project tried to fix this by allowing end users to connect through an automatically configured ip tunnel over networks which did not natively support ip multicast
the idea was that if more users have multicast capability more content providers would see the benefit of streaming content over multicast
the hope was if enough content providers and users used this service then more internet service providers would enable ip multicast natively to their customers  castgate supplied a software client for both microsoft windows and linux to connect to the castgate tunnel network
it also supplied tools to add tunnel servers and tools to receive session announcement protocol announcements from the multicast network with video and audio streams  the project maintained a web site through 2007

i love katamari  塊魂モバイル  katamari damashii mobairu   lit clump spirit mobile is a third-person puzzle-action video game published by namco for the ios  it is a continuation of the katamari damacy series of games it was released worldwide in the app store on december 14 2008  2008-12-14   in 2010 namco announced a windows phone 7 version of the game  a version was released for android in 2012 exclusively for samsung android devices  in this game the king of the cosmos instructs the games protagonist — the prince — to gather as many objects as possible to grow a highly-adhesive ball called a katamari large enough so that he can pick up special objects to bring to the king so that he can regain his memory  the gameplay is identical to that of katamari damacy  where the player rolls a highly-adhesive ball called a katamari  collecting various objects of increasing size until it becomes large enough to transform into a star the game utilizes the specialized technology from the iphone and ipod touch in which players tilt the device to move the katamari across the playing field i love katamari received mixed reviews while it has been praised for its game presentation it has also been criticized for performance and control issues the performance and control issues were improved in an update but not entirely fixed in i love katamari  the player controls a highly–adhesive ball called the katamari  the object is to make the katamari as large as possible by running over and collecting objects of increasing size the more objects players collect the larger the katamari becomes one reviewer described the game as follows basically the object is to roll a ball around a level and pick up as much junk as you can to make the ball bigger it sounds epic and it’s fun to play and really addicting  instead of using analog controllers to control the katamari as in the home console katamari games players roll the katamari by tilting the iphoneipod touch in the direction they want the katamari to go  the goal is to collect specific objects requested by the king of the cosmos within a specified time limit  i love katamari has received some praise and some criticism from various reviewers while some reviewers such as nicole lee from cnet praised the game for its intuitive usage of the iphoneipod touch technology  other reviewers such as luke plunkett from kotaku and levi buchanan from ign have heavily criticized the game for its lack of responsiveness in controls and handling of the katamari as well as software lag that could cause the game to freeze    namco bandai released an update for the game improving some performance and control problems previously experienced by users

najib anton albina 2 january 1901  - 23 july 1983   was the master photographer of the palestine archaeological museum and in that position took the first original sets of photographs of the dead sea scrolls   through his positions with the american colony and palestine archaeological museum he used photography as a means of recording the history of christian palestinian culture as well as the discovery of past cultures in the region  he had a significant impact on the techniques of archeological photographers especially those who took pictures of the dead sea scrolls through his contributions to the use of infrared photography  najib was born the son of anton albina and victoria safieh on 2 january 1901 in jerusalem which belonged to the ottoman empire   both of his parents were of christian palestinian decent  he was one of three brothers and one sister  his father anton went missing in action in 1918 during a world war i campaign before 1930 he married adele morcos 1911 - 1965   a christian palestinian from jericho   she bore them eight children between 1930 and 1950 najib worked as a darkroom technician and photographer for the photographic division of the american colony directly under lewis larsson from the early 1920s through the mid-1930s  he worked primarily taking and developing film of archaeological sites in the greater jerusalem area however he also worked developing motion pictures   he worked alongside his brother jamil albina in the photographic division  many of the photographs taken by najib jamil and lewis larsson are publicly available through the library of congress  from 20 january 1952 until 1967 najib albina served as the master photographer of the palestine archaeological museum pam  during this time najib was able to photograph most of the museums collection of fragments and manuscripts using broadband fluorescence infrared photography   a process known as reflected nir
photography    najib assembled over 1750 photographic plates for the museum of the scrolls  using large format film   in addition the photographs were taken on animal skin and allowed the text to standout making the plates especially useful for assembling fragments  being the earliest photographs of the museums collection the most complete in the world at the time they recorded the fragment and scrolls before their further decay in storage and are often considered the best recorded copies of the scrolls  some of this decay was as a direct consequence of the museum storage in damp cellars  and the environmental conditions with which the museum allowed the fragments and scrolls to be exposed such as smoking including by najib in fact even some of the pams negatives taken by najib have been destroyed due to poor storage and care  najib took five sets not all complete of the dead sea scrolls  the sets spanned the sorting process of the scrolls from unsorted to complete vertical format as assembled by editors at the pam with most of the scrolls and fragments being photographed at least three times  during the process najib recorded his progress and work with the scrolls in a log book still held today by the israel antiquities authority  in addition to photographing the fragments and scrolls of the dead sea scrolls collection for the pam najib also took other photographs for the museum  this included but was not limited to site photographs  many of the site photographs for the dead sea scrolls were referenced by notations of the film plates that najib put together for the museum  the dead sea scroll site photographs taken by najib were made on 13 x 18 cm format film  other projects were assigned to him on an ad hoc basis by yusuf saad  the museums curator at the time  such projects including taking photographs of wilsons arch  and beth-zur    the museum fell from jordanian to israeli control in 1967 as a result of the six-days war and there was significant fighting at the museum sight  unlike during the suez crisis  the dead sea scrolls collection was not moved to a more secure location like the ottoman bank   this may have been because of the damages the collection sustained during that period  palestinian arabs attacked the museum and attempted to loot some of the contents putting najib at gunpoint to unlock the glass plates behind which the dead sea scrolls were stored  he lied said he did not have the keys and noted that he himself was arab  after being held for three days he was released  soon after the arabs lost control of the museum to israeli forces who used parts of the museum as a lookout tower  after the event najib left employment of the museum in 1967  najib was made an offer to return full-time as the master photographer under the new israeli management of the renamed pam now known as the rockefeller museum as the early grants and availability of funds allowed the museum to do so  he declined both in protest to the change in national management of the museum and because there were significant restrictions on his familys living conditions in jerusalem najib had seven children five girls and two boys lillan lima lorraine lucy vicky issa and joseph
after najibs exile to the united states  just before the beginning of the six-day war  he settled in los angeles  california   during this time individuals pressured him and his family to turn over photographs of the dead sea scrolls  however as part of the agreement with the palestine archaeological museum he had already turned over the photographs  negatives  and photographic equipment as they were museum property after retiring and moving to virginia najib albina died there on 23 july 1983 of a heart attack   he is buried at st marys cemetery in fairfax virginia

still in the seventies in a seminal paper co-authored with jack edmonds  johnson showed how several basic optimization problems defined on graphs can be solved in polynomial time by reducing them to weighted matching problems one example is finding minimum t-joins ie edge sets whose only endpoints of odd degree are those in a specified vertex set t an important special case is the seemingly difficult problem of finding a shortest tour in a graph that traverses every edge at least once known as the postman problem the stark contrast between the polynomial solvability of this problem and the intractability of the traveling salesman problem in which the tour is supposed to traverse vertices rather than edges helped focus attention on the phenomenon so typical of combinatorial structures two seemingly very similar problems turn out in reality to be vastly different

 daraban is a town of tehsil kulachi in dera ismail khan district of khyber-pakhtunkhwa   it is located at 31°443n 70°2011e and has an altitude of 221 metres 728 feet  daraban kalan pronounced “draban “ is to be distinguished from daraban khurd a village lying to the east of dera ismail khan city draban lies 40 miles  west of dera ismail khan in the foothills of sulaiman mountains  there are various theories as to the origin of the word daraban the word “daraban” according to some accounts actually came from term ”durruh-bund” which means the closed pass centuries back the people who settled down in present day draban aimed to close the pass which connected draban with sherani hills sherani hill tribe in those days was in habit of pillaging villages in damaan below their hills the term durruh_bund”  in due course of time became the name of the village of people living in present day draban  ”durruh-bund” got shortened as daraban and now in further reduced form the word is pronounced as draban  according to another popular narrative  the words daraban and darazinda the chief town of fr sherani originate in similar sound are persian in origin  and can be traced back to dara shikoh a son of mughal king shajahan daraban as per this account gets translated as dara’s forest here came to hunt wild animals while  darazianda was his zindan or prison there he kept his prisoners the former account as to the origin of the name of the town seems more plausible and is very much attested by the history of enmity and hostility between sherani tribe and miankhel pashtoon possessors of draban not much is known about the earliest history of daraban perhaps it grew out of small villages lying in the foothills of sulaiman mountains and later on due to its excellent geographical setting grew in size and population its early inhabitants could have been either saraikis or pashtoons or both the idea of saraikis being the indigenous people of the region  is bolstered by the fact that the region is part of baloch heartland and baloch speak either balochi or saraiki in addition saraikis constitute the majority of district dera ismail khan so it seems plausible that pashtoons were the later arrivals in daraban and areas around it on the other hand it is equally possible that pashtoon nomadic tribes founded daraban if the name daraban really originated in ”durruh-bund” then pashtoons were its founders as they aimed to close pass leading to the mountains because of their quarrels and blood feuds with the sheranis the pashtoons have been coming into this western part of dera ismail khan through gomal pass since the 13th century these pashtoon powindas followed patterns of seasonal migration they journeyed in caravans to dera ismail khan and other lands beyond indus  and returned to  afghanistan with the onset of hot weather  with the passage of time some of these nomads began to settle on the land on permanent basis  the lodhi tribe is believed to have settled in the area of draban in the time of shahbu -din -ghori in the beginning of 13th centaury  in between  1555 and 1600 ad miankhels tribe invaded the area and after defeating  the lodhis became the new possessors of draban the miankhels are still  most influential in terms of politics and economics in draban and neighbouring musazai town  historical pattern of pashtoons leaving their mountains and settling on  the plains of damaan continues even today  many sheranis of the sulaiman mountains have settled in draban permanently in addition nasir another pashtoon tribe has casting aside its nomadic way of life has  started living in  permanent settlements in the peripheries of  daraban the said tribe being the newest arrival has not been accorded proper acceptance as a legal residents of daraban and their hasty attempts at getting political influence has given rise  to  whole sorts of conflicts between drabanwals and the nasirs the region constituting present day khyber-pakhtunkhwa was eventually colonised by the british the effects and remains of colonialism could be observed even this remote part of dera ismail khan  the british built chains of frontier constabulary forts in the region to hold in check independent pashtoons of the mountains darazinda  draban  and zarkani have fc forts built by the british from these forts the british launched punitive expeditions in the mountains  daraban boasts an fc fort assistant commissioner court and large colonial style rest house all relics of the raj   within the compound of the assistant commissioner residence  lies the grave of a british officer who died in action in zarkani in colonial times  the british also built two bridges over the two perennial water streams flowing from the sulaiman mountains  the larger one was known locally as kali pul and smaller one was called sawi pul  kali pul some years ago  was sold in auction after the government replaced it with a new modern one the british connected dera ismail khan  through telephone with fr sherani and zhob balochistan this  telephone line is no longer in service  and its poles and wires lying in utter neglect continue to be  stolen by thieves saraiki is the dominant language of  daraban and its adjoining areas pahsto is the 2nd most widely spoken language  draban enjoys  rare and unique position of being the  melting point of cultures and languages the coming of the pashtoons  over the centuries in this part of the land has resulted in their interaction with the local  saraikis now things have come to such a pass that  both linguistic groups have become bilingual pashtoons  speak saraiki like  native speakers and the saraikis speak pasthto fluently it is only nasir and sherani people who speak only pashto miankhels and other pashtoons speak fluent saraiki in addition to their own native tongue  centuries of close interaction of pasthto with saraiki have given the former language a unique saraiki touch and saraiki has under the influence of pasthto  acquired a unique flavour of its own although  saraiki speakers constitute the majority of the region still  their role and influence is much reduced in ratio to their population pashtoons own vast tracts of agricultural land and have dominant political influence in the areaethnic and racial strife between  pashtoons and saraikis is non-existentstill pashtoons like to marry  only within their own community daraban  lies at the foot of sulaiman mountains  the majestic peaks of takht e sulaiman covered with snow as seen in daraban present a spectacular view the myths relating to takht e sulaiman are a part of folk lore of the people who live in whole of damaan daraban enjoys privileged geographic position in the whole of neighbouring region and this accounts for its burgeoning trade and population the town is connected by road with neighbouring towns of  darazinada musazai and chaudwanthe inhabitants of these towns have to pass through daraban while journeying to dera ismail khan city daraban also lies on the national highway connecting khyber-pakhtunkhwa with baluchistan the highway was built by national highway authority almost eight years ago and  is playing vital role in the development and progress of this region traveling to zhob and quetta from khyber-pakhtunkhwa was quite difficult  before the construction of this highway travelers had to suffer a long ordeal in travelling to balochistan through a much longer route via the province of punjab and sindh the highway has also resulted in increase of trade and commerce in daraban and areas around it in terms of literacy rate  and educational standards  draban and its bordering areas  lag behind the rest of dera ismail khan  a high school was established  in the town in 1953 but only  a decade ago it was  upgraded to the status of higher secondary school the town of draban itself offers little in terms of sightseeing tourism or adventure so it is neighbouring mountains where mostly people end up in their quest for enjoymentrecreation and fun excursion to draban zam is have become quite popular among the young of the town there they get abundant opportunities of swimming dancing and eating near darazinda peer ghundai another sight of abundant waterfalls and nice scenery is major attraction but it is trip to takht-e-sulaiman which is most popular excursion for the people the trip to this 3400 m high summit is undertaken in summer and usually takes two days journey on foot over difficult mountain terrain on summit there is a religious shrine and a takht related with prophet sulaiman to the south of draban lies important town of  musa zai sharif boasting  an important khankah of nashbaniah  sufi tradition  the shrine houses tombs of hazrat dost muhammad qandhari hazrat usman damani hazrat sirjuddin hazrat ibrahim hazrat ismail the shrine of musa zai is quite well known in the whole region  and the devotees  visit it from all over pakistanafghanistan india and even from arab countrieskhankah of hazrat shaikh ghulam yaseen sahibknown as hazrat agah sahib and tombs of his sons hazrat faiz muhammad sahibhazrat muhammad din sahib is well known and people from all over of the pakistan come to visit their tombs the following is an account of journey undertaken in 2001 by salahuddin sikander the contributor of daraban page on  wikipedia  and his friends to takht-i-sulaiman the account was published in daily dawn  daily the frontier post and  daily the  news  takht-i-sulaiman the highest peak of the sulaiman range 3382 metre  11437 feet is shrouded in myth and mystery named after solomon the wise jewish prophet the peak on account of its perceived association with the prophet is believed to possess a strange healing quality people in damaan also believe that prophet sulaiman by exercising his miraculous power had confined those mischievous jinns inside it who had refused to obey his command the evil-spirited jinns are supposed to remain imprisoned almost all the year and in safar the second month of the islamic calendar they are allowed to go free for a while during this month after darkness falls over the region mothers restrict their children within their homes as a precaution against the evil effects of these jinns takht-i-sulaiman rises to a height of 3382 meters above sea level a trip to the mountain is undertaken mostly in summer and in winter heavy snowfall makes it difficult to approach it from late november until march animal sacrifice is an essential feature of a visit to sulaiman the locals believe that infertile women can be blessed with fertility when they visit takht-i-sulaiman religious connotations apart takht-i-sulaiman is an area of outstanding natural beauty boasting spectacular mountains which offer endless opportunities of trekking and climbing it can be reached either through balochistan or nwfp it is advised for convenience’s sake to start the journey from di khan draban kalan a town 40 miles off to the west offers a convenient approach to it public transport heading up the ragha sar the base of sulaiman is available here last summer a few of us with our friend ivan mannheim boarded the local bus and headed westwards the bus crossed the wide stony plain part of damaan which stretches for about 120 km between di khan and dg khan sandwiched between the sulaiman mountains to the west and indus river to the east the road then cut through a ridge of low hill and took us to drazinda the tehsil headquarters after a brief stop here the bus drove forward winding its way through the mountains then turning west from the main di khan-zhob road the track followed the right bank of a gorge and led to the village of ragasar ragasar is a village at the head of the gorge stone and mud huts show that the modern aspects of civilisation have not reached this village in is inhabited by the friendly and hospitable sherani tribe hostility is reserved within the tribe only bloods feuds are common confirmed by the sight of the guns hanging over the shoulders of many people after on overnight stay here the next morning our journey to takht-i-sulaiman began we set out with the necessary provisions and the valuable guidance of sultan khan our friend and host shortly afterwards the track forked right to descent and a swift flowing foamy white stream could be seen flowing down with a roaring sound the narrow track along the stream was pretty strenuous to travel on as there were many small boulders and pointed stones precipitous walls of the mountain were on either side the track cutting its way through sheer rock mountain led us into an open area with the magnificent mountain all around the four-hour track from ragasar came to an abrupt end as we climbed up a nearby hill to undergo the next stage of another strenuous journey to reach the next village perched on a hilltop is tora tisha a cluster of four or five stone huts surrounded by a spectacular mountain amphitheatre after half a day’s journey on a demanding track from ragasar tora tisha mosque made an ideal place for relaxation food and prayer the path then headed up from the village and crossed a small bridge of tree planks and twigs built over a narrow gorge deep down water seemed gushing forth at tremendous speed we proceeded further on and were asked to perform the formidable task of making an ascent up a sheer rock wall the track on it zigzagging its way up to its top but our apprehension melted down as the track was comfortably wide for us when the tack finally ended the scenery before us was breathtaking as we could see for miles below us due to the elevation we were at we could see the slopes of the mighty thakt-i-sulaiman which were covered with green forests making the sight appear spectacular we were supposed to make our way through them before completing the first leg of our journey for that day a smooth climb over a mountain nearby led us straight to those pine forests we were immediately impressed by lush green landscape that looked enchanting chilgoza and nashtar trees could be seen growing in abundance the track now smooth and straight was splashed with brilliant patches of beauty it led us forth to poonga a small village it was the end of our first day’s journey as we would be staying there overnight poonga spills down the mountainside it offers a panoramic view of the landscape lush green mountains covered with tall trees and lots of flowers could also be seen growing in the wild there was a distinctive silence that is peculiar to mountainous countryside the next morning we took up the tack to the north of the village the track is a long hard uphill slog notwithstanding its share of picturesque scenery further ahead however the track turns smooth with an easy stroll that runs along the flank of the mountain with a large rock overhang either side of the track is carpeted with wild flowers the track then starts to turn and ascend and at one point it crosses the mountain the view on the other side was simply breathtaking the vast landscape was characterised by lush green pastures and dense chalghoza forest impressed by the beauty of the valley a decision was made in favour of making a detour from the main track and visiting the valley it was an idyllic place with a dazzling array of wild flowers the track passed a pine forest as well as a meadow surrounded by trees all around a visit to takht-i-sulaiman is not complete without a brief foray into this beautiful region we rejoined the main track and reached kalkarai at dusk after an overnight stay there the next morning we took a path to the right which led steeply to the peak in sheer contrast to the landscape below the region around the top has been a victim to intense logging there is even a camel route for the transportation of timber to zhobe the top which once had plenty of pine trees now wears a somewhat desolate look on the top we observed many things a stone-built room came into view those who intend to have an overnight stay make use of it rainfall fills up a water pool to be used by visitors under a shady tree there is a grave of unusually large size qaisa abdul rasheed is said to have been buried here the locals believe him to be an ancestor of the pakhtoons a small clean place near the end of the mountain was used as a mosque said to mark the point where prophet sulaiman would land towards its end were few stones firmly fixed in the ground holding them in hands we were to climb down for about 10 feet on the side of the mountain to the takht it is a small stone slab with barely enough space for a man to stand or sit two of its corners were fixed in the mountainside the rest in open air holding the stones in hand a pilgrim is supposed to descend down to takht to offer his prayer from the top we enjoyed a panoramic view of the surrounding area far away the huge expanse of damaan was also visible to the north was waziristan and to the west was a chain of mountains that marked the region of balochistan another breath taking scene from top takht-i-sulaiman is a region of unimaginable beauty but local loggers pose a serious environmental threat to its very existence it is time that the concerned authorities take some serious actions to preserve its ecosystem the government has so far been totally apathetic to this tragedy it has imposed a ban on the export of the timber from sulaiman mountains but there are more than one ways of smuggling it western slops of the range provide an easy access to loggers to zhob balochistan the government must also pay heed to the genuine problems of sherani tribal area and should take concrete measures to eradicate poverty illiteracy and backwardness from the area some remarks which i happened to see a short while ago in one of the monthly magazines on the subject of the takht e suleiman were calculated to lead one to suppose that the summit of that mountain has never yet been reached by a european the name of this mountain is so well known from its mythical geographical and ethnological associations that it may interest some of the readers of the geographical journal to know that its summit has been reached by europeans this mountain which with its sister peak of qaisaghar form the highest points of the suleiman range of the north-west frontier of india is situated in the territory of the sheranis who until brought under british control in the winter of 1890 were an independent and extremely troublesome border tribe many legends attach to it according to some noahs ark alighted here after the deluge while others from this the mountain derives its name connect it with solomon who as the story goes once came to hindustan to marry a lady named balkis while returning from india with his bride in a flying throne the lady requested solomon to stop for a while to enable her to take a last fond look at her native land thereupon the throne alighted on this peak which has ever since borne the name of takht e suleiman or solomons throne ethnologically the mountain is considered by some to have been the birthplace of the pushto speaking races from these and other legends connected with this mountain the shrine situated near its summit has been for many centuries the place of pilgrimage of such adventurous pilgrims who were hardy enough to face the dangers of the road through the wild tribes of the country and the difficulties of the mountain itself a native surveyor is said to have reached the shrine about a hundred years ago while somewhat later two englishmen messrs fraser and harris members of elphinstones mission of 1809 are said to have attempted the ascent without success the military expedition sent to survey this mountain in 1884 succeeded in reaching the summit of the qaisaghar peak close by which is 11300 feet and some 200 feet higher than the peak of the takht itself no attempt was made to scale the takht which was said to be inaccessible during the sherani expedition in december 1890 general sir george white the then commander-in-chief of india in order to show the sheranis that even their most remote mountain fastnesses were not inaccessible to british troops ascended the mountain from the eastern side accompanied by a small party of picked men and succeeded after some two days hard climbing in reaching a point on the east line of the hill but was unable to devote the time necessary for an attempt to reach either the shrine or the actual summit major mcivor then political agent at zhob and my self determined the following year to attempt the ascent and found ourselves on 28 june 1891 at the pezai spring on the western slopes of the range - the highest point at which spring water on that side is obtainable at dawn on the 29th we commenced the actual ascent and by the evening after a hard days climb reached the crest-line at the point where the famous shrine is situated here we found a couple of rough stone hut shelters erected by pilgrims in which former visitors had each in turn left cooking-vessels and supplies of flour and rice for the use of them who might come after them the actual shrine was close by and within a few yards but far from a pleasant place to get at the face of the mountain at this point on the eastern side is a sheer precipice of many thousands of feet the shrine is some 20 feet down below the edge of the precipice and consists of a small ledge of rock about 4t feet long by 3 feet wide with a slight artificial parapet of rocks on the outer sides about a foot in height it is reached by four-foot-holes cut or worn away in the rock the hand and foot-hold is good but the edge of the precipice appears slightly to overhang the little ledge below and the sensation therefore experienced in going down or coming up over the edge of the precipice is only equalled by that of seeing someone else do so all pilgrims apparently do not enter this shrine but content themselves with looking down into it from above those who do descend have a small token in the form of a small piece of stick which they fix into the interstices of the little rock parapet both of us descended and left our stick tokens the look down into space from this little ledge does not tempt one to make a very long stay there the crest of the mountain at the shrine is not the highest point which is at one of the three knob-like peaks at the south end of the crest these we determined to ascend if possible next day notwithstanding the assurances of our native guides that these peaks were quite inaccessible after a cold night on the crest on the ground where some snow was still lying in patches we commenced a hard days work each of the three peaks before us was separated from the place in which we were and from each other by precipitous gaps in the crest-line and the ascent certainly did not appear hopeful without describing the many adventures of the day it will suffice to say that we both succeeded in reaching the tops of all three peaks and also i am glad to say in discovering a possible way down again - a matter which at one time appeared somewhat doubtful this is the first occasion on which europeans have reached either the shrine or the summit of the peak of the takht e suleiman no one has as far as i know gone up to either place since captain mcmahon was the british joint commissioner of the afghan-balochistan boundary commission and he sent this correspondence via his camp in fort sandeman while stationed at zhob balochistan on 8 august 1894 this correspondence was published in the geographical journal volume 4 number 5 in november 1894 “daraban is a small section of the daaman proper it lies south and southwest of the area of the gandappor its boundary with kulachi on the north is the nullah or stream of zarkunee or swan on the west the outer ridge of the tukht-sooliman on the south with the babhurs a line of pillars laid down by an englishman in 1847
the daraban generally resembles the neighbouring area of the gandapoors but daraban is more undulated toward the hills its village are surrounded by more trees and vegetation and on the whole it wears a more cheerful and prosperous appearance
the possessors of daraban are the miankhel a branch of the great lohanee tribe who took it from a tribe of afghan fakers called surwani now almost extent and another tribe named the bukhtiars whom elephantine describes as having come originally from persia the subdivisions of miankhel are as follow
miankhel
sotkheyl hoosseinkheyl
syedkhel shadikhel omerzai vurrookee
baloochkhel ukakhel mushakhel moosehzye
ubakhel shaheekhel zakoree
mallakhel gholamkheyl
passani
the above families divided the land of daraban with the bukhtiars thus one-fourth of the country was monopolised of the mossazai the most powerful branch of the miankhel to be the mossazai was subdivided into four families named tajokhel khanokhel muddikhel mummundzai no other family of the miankhel had any interest in the land of moosehzyes who formed a village named moosehzye on the southern border of the daraban daraban kalan is the center of different villages
it is said that in the same year daraban boasted a single mango tree the fruit of which had such a delicious flavour that rangeet singh used to have it sent to him at lahore
the pass of zarkani is about two koss from the village of the same name which is in the area of daraban kalan
the village of zirkani is the exclusive property of sheikhs who are descendants of a celebrated saint named sheikh hyder a stream of the purest water reaches the village from the pass and its course is marked by several sheeshum-tree which give the spot a picturesque appearance zirkani is rendered still more remarkable by its sacred ground containing the cemeteries of the powindays the graves compactly made of piled stones some all white carefully selected and all have large upright stones placed at the head it is by the zarkani pass that caravans of powindays go to kandahar and rest of afghanistan
fort of akhond daraban
about five or six miles to the south of the zirkani pass is the pass of daraban the mouth of which is about eight miles from daraban itself not very far from midway between the town and the pass of daraban but rather nearer to the latter are ruins of the former fort of akhoond gul habib this akhond belonged to a tribe called hurrial connected with sheranies the same probably as that of hurreepaul mentioned by mrelphinstone as a branch of the sheramies residing in the hills and vallaeys at the western base of tukht-i-sooliman  he thought to settle quietly in area west of daraban kalan and built here a fort  it is interesting to note that the descendants of akhoond still live in daraban and one of them aallaudin khonzada was till his death three years ago leading political figure of daraban
dheyra daraban
close to the fort of gul habib stands a rainfurrowed mound called by the people a dheyr and which according to some scholers could ba a link in the chain of graeco bactrian outposts on the frontier of tank or this mound could be more recent nearly 5oo years old opinions vary lahoruhdaraban
from the daraban pass issues the lahoruh a parnial stream which floods in hot summers and it flows by daraban town and divides it into two parts the course of the stream is beautifully marked and shaded by sheeshum-trees
about five miles of pass of daraban and farther to the south is the plass of zam from which flows a stream which is the ancient boundaries between the miankhail of moosezai and the babhurs of choudwan and which has caused a bloody feud by dividing into two branches
chouwan
the area of chiudwan like daraban kolachi and tank is a section of the eastern daman of the soolimanee range having daraban on the north the oostraunee lowlands on the south and the sherani and oosteraunee hills on the west
the babhurs of old times were said to have been in possession of a written order from ahmad shah of kabul to a sardar named jehan khan  directing him to proceed to the daman and settle the boundaries of the miankhails with both the gandapoors and the babhurs  this document was accompanied by another containing the srdars decision by which the sawan or zirkunnee nullah was settled to be the boundary between daraban and kolachi and the nullah called kowruh between daraban and choudwan the authenticity of both documents was acknowledged on both sodes but arise as to the indenty of kowruh nullah alluded to
there is a little rivulet about two hundred yards to the south of moosazai which is called kowruh to the day and this the babhurs maintained to be the boundary of jahan khans decision
there is another and larger one about two koss to the south of moosazai which is called turkhoba and this the miankhails declared to be the ancient kowruh
mr elphinstone found the babhurs forty years ago a civilized tribe much addicted to merchandise and on the whole the richest and most flourishing of the tribes of daman
there bravery has been sufficiently established by their blood feud with the powerful miankhails whom they almost rival in commerce also and their general intelligence as a tribe has given rise to many proverbs one says that  a babhur fool is a gandapoor sage another tells how the babhurs ventured into agricultural partnership with the devil and gave him his choice of the roots or stocks of the harvest  the devil choosing the stocks they sowed nothing but onions carrots and turnips  the devils very naturally annoyed insisted next harvest on getting the roots so the babhurs grew wheat and sugar” hidayat khan coordinates  31°44′3″n 70°20′11″e ﻿  ﻿ 3173417°n 7033639°e ﻿  3173417 7033639 1 2
